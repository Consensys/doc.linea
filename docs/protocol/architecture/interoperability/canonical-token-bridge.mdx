The canonical token bridge is the pair of [“lock & mint” contracts](../../../network/build/contracts.mdx#token-bridge-contracts) that allow bridging of any 
ERC-20 token. The bridge relies on the
[message service](./canonical-message-service.mdx)
for cross-chain interactions.

## Next steps

- See the UI for the [official public Linea bridge](https://linea.build/hub/bridge/).

- For the public network's workflow, ABI references, and bridge interfaces, see the
[canonical token bridge guide](../../../network/build/bridge.mdx) and
[contracts](../../../network/build/contracts.mdx).
