This section covers the protocol-level mechanisms that enable secure cross-chain communication,
value transfer, and message verification between Linea and other chains.

Interoperability in Linea is enabled by:

- [Canonical Token Bridge](./canonical-token-bridge.mdx): a protocol contract and process that allows token transfers with
  finalization guarantees.
- [Message Service](./message-service/index.mdx): a generalized cross-chain messaging primitive for application data.
