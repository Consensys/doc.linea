As an EVM-compatible protocol, Linea uses a dual-layer architecture that separates consensus from
execution. This separation enables independent evolution of protocol components while preserving
deterministic execution, verifiable state transitions, and Ethereum-level security guarantees.

This page describes the protocol view of Linea: the logical components, their responsibilities,
and how they interact to process transactions and reach finality.

For operational deployment details, see the [the Linea stack](../../stack/index.mdx).

## Dual-layer architecture

The Linea protocol separates consensus from execution:

- Consensus layer: Responsible for block production, validator coordination, and block propagation
- Execution layer: Responsible for executing transactions, maintaining EVM state, and exposing a
  standard execution interface

Each block is proposed by the execution layer while the consensus layer signs and broadcasts it.

The two layers communicate via the Engine API, a standard Ethereum interface that cleanly
separates consensus logic from execution semantics. This separation allows Linea to support client
diversity and protocol extensibility without coupling execution correctness to consensus mechanics.

## Protocol components

The Linea protocol consists of the following logical components. These components define protocol
behavior and guarantees. The following represents the main components of Linea, and how they interact:

### Consensus layer

[Maru](../repos.mdx#maru) implements the consensus layer of the Linea protocol. It coordinates
validator participation, block production, and block propagation using the QBFT algorithm.

Maru ensures agreement on block ordering and provides fault tolerance under Byzantine conditions.

### Execution layer

[Linea Besu](../repos.mdx#linea-besu-upstream) is the recommended execution client for the Linea
protocol. It executes transactions, maintains EVM state, and exposes the execution interface used
by the consensus layer.

:::info

While all execution clients maintain the EVM state and execute transactions, only Linea Besu provides
full protocol-specific
extensions required for sequencing, tracing, and proof generation, including speed optimizations, and features like
  [`linea_estimateGas`](../../api/reference/linea-estimategas).

[Geth](../../network/how-to/run-a-node/geth.mdx) and [Erigon](../../network/how-to/run-a-node/erigon.mdx) are more suitable for follower or archive roles, respectively.

### Sequencer

The [sequencer](./sequencer/index.mdx) orders transactions and builds blocks according to Linea
protocol rules. It enforces constraints on block composition and ensures that execution outputs are
suitable for downstream proving.

### Coordinator

The [coordinator](./coordinator.mdx) orchestrates batching, proof generation, and submission to the
finalization layer. It coordinates the interaction between execution outputs, state tracking, and
proof systems.

### Prover

The [prover](./prover/index.mdx) generates zero-knowledge proofs attesting to correct state
transitions. These proofs provide cryptographic guarantees that execution followed the protocol
rules without requiring re-execution on the finalization layer.

### State manager

The [Shomei state manager](./state-manager.mdx) maintains a state representation optimized for
proof generation and verification. It tracks state transitions and produces the data required to
construct zk-SNARK proofs.

### Tracer

The [tracer](../repos.mdx#linea-tracer) produces execution traces during transaction processing.
Trace data is used as input to the proving system and is essential for validating execution
correctness.

## Onchain system contracts

Smart contracts execute deterministic programs on the EVM and are immutable once deployed. The
Linea protocol relies on a set of onchain system contracts that define settlement, verification,
and cross-chain interaction.

These contracts are deployed in the following locations:

### Finalization layer

The finalization contract verifies zk-SNARK proofs and records finalized state roots. It anchors
Linea state to the security guarantees of the finalization layer.

### Linea execution layer

Protocol contracts deployed on Linea enable settlement workflows, token issuance, and
network-specific functionality.

### Both layers

Bridge contracts deployed on both Linea and the finalization layer enable cross-chain message
passing and asset transfers. For protocol-specific bridge mechanics, see the
[canonical token bridge](./interoperability/canonical-token-bridge.mdx) and the
[message service](./interoperability/message-service/index.mdx).

For a complete list and descriptions of the smart contracts used on the Public Network, see
[system smart contracts](../../network/build/contracts.mdx).

## Data availability and finalization

The Linea protocol separates state correctness from data availability. zk-SNARK proofs attest
to correct execution, while data availability guarantees depend on the chosen deployment model:

- Private Validium deployments
  Transaction data is retained offchain within a private node set; only proofs and finalized state
  roots are submitted to the finalization layer.

- Hybrid deployments
  Data availability varies by transaction type.

- Public deployments
  Transaction data and associated payloads are posted to the finalization layer, for example via
  EIP-4844 blobs on Ethereum.

For protocol-level context on batching, finality, and data publication, see
[transaction lifecycle](../transaction-lifecycle.mdx) and [network data](../network-data.mdx).

## Next steps

- Review bridge mechanics in the [message service](./interoperability/message-service/index.mdx)
- Review cross-chain settlement in the [canonical token bridge](./interoperability/canonical-token-bridge.mdx)
- Understand protocol fees in [gas](../tokenomics/gas.mdx) and [burn](../tokenomics/burn.mdx)
