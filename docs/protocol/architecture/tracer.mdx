## What is it?

The [tracer](../repos.mdx#linea-tracer) run as a plug-in to Linea Besu. It provides the Traces API that surfaces essential data that's required for proof generation. 

## What does it do?

The tracer ensures that the required data is available for all blocks in a batch:

- Generates execution traces during block processing
- Provides trace counts for batch size calculations
- Creates conflated trace files for prover input

This data that represents the operations undertaken in the EVM during the block execution is passed to the prover, allowing it to generate the execution proof.
