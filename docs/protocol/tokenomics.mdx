The LINEA token is designed to grow and support Ethereum and Linea, and has several radical features 
that set it apart from most layer 2 tokens:
- ETH is the gas token
- LINEA does not come with any governance rights
- There is no token allocation for insiders, investors, or team members.

Instead, LINEA will help to organically grow the chain by being distributed to users as a reward for 
using apps and protocols on Linea. 

The token's contract address on Linea Mainnet and Ethereum Mainnet is [`0x1789e0043623282D5DCc7F213d703C6D8BAfBB04`](https://lineascan.build/address/0x1789e0043623282D5DCc7F213d703C6D8BAfBB04).

This page explains the rationale behind token distribution. If you're looking for help with claiming 
your airdrop, using the token, or any other common issues, see the [Linea support page](https://support.linea.build/linea-hub/airdrop).

:::

## Allocation

LINEA will have a **total supply of 72,009,990,000**. This 1,000x the genesis supply of ETH on 
Ethereum.

85% of the supply of LINEA will be be invested in the community and ecosystem, comprising the 
Ecosystem Fund, with 15% held long-term by Consensys.

  </div>
</div>

The supply will be allocated according to the below table:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Category</th>
		<th>% of supply</th>
		<th>Details</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ecosystem</td>
		<td>85%</td>
		<td>75% for a long-term Ecosystem Fund, and 10% for early contributors.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Consensys treasury</td>
		<td>15%</td>
		<td>Locked (non-transferrable) for five years. Consensys will hold the tokens long-term for 
		alignment and to support Linea and its ecosystem.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Except from the initial allocation to Consensys, which is locked for five years, there is **no 
allocation to private investors, insiders, or employees and team members**. Instead, value is 
funneled straight into the ecosystem, the builders bringing it to fruition, and the community members 
engaging with it. 

At the time of the token generation event (TGE), 22% of the LINEA supply will be in circulation, 
split between a user and builder airdrop, ecosystem activations, and liquidity provisioning.

All other allocations will be locked at TGE, or vesting according to various schedules.

## Ecosystem (85%)

### Early contributors (10%)

The initial airdrop for early contributors, comprising 10% of the supply, will include:
- 9% to early contributors
- 1% to strategic builders

The early contributor airdrop for users will be based on onchain activity over the long term, including 
LXP. An eligibility checker will be available before TGE. The 1% allocation for builders will be 
distributed through a curated, targeted process for maximum impact.
	
All tokens distributed through the above airdrops are fully unlocked.

### Ecosystem Fund (75%)

The long-term section of the Ecosystem Fund will be managed by the Linea Consortium.

This 75% will unlock over 10 years, with unlocks weighted towards the earlier years to encourage 
early activation and adoption. Unlocks occur early — 10% per year in the early years, tapering to 2% 
by the tenth year.

These funds will be used for:
- Funding for Ethereum R&D
- Maintaining shared ecosystem infrastructure such as audits, developer tools, and node infrastructure
- Funding public goods, such as open-source software, research, and community programs
- Strategic co-development with aligned organizations or emerging protocols.

## Consensys treasury (15%)

15% of the total token supply will be incorporated into the Consensys treasury. This allocation will 
be locked for five years and is non-transferrable until a vesting schedule is complete.

## Burning mechanism

After covering infrastructure costs, 100% of surplus revenue gets burned:

- **20% burned as ETH**
- **80% converted to LINEA and burned**

### How burning works on Linea

Linea and the LINEA token are designed specifically to reinforce the strength of Ethereum and ETH, 
achieved through an automatic, dual-burn mechanism:
- All gas fees on Linea are paid in ETH
- 20% of net ETH profits (Linea revenue minus operating costs and subsidies) will be burned, 
  reducing ETH supply
- 80% of net ETH profits are used to burn LINEA, reducing LINEA supply.

As a result, network activity on Linea directly supports both the value of ETH and LINEA. 

Every transaction on Linea generates gas fees paid in ETH. Instead of keeping these fees, Linea's 
burn mechanism permanently removes ETH and LINEA tokens from circulation. This creates deflationary 
pressure on both tokens, directly benefiting holders and the broader ecosystem.

This means Linea becomes a perpetual buyer of its own token while simultaneously reducing ETH supply.

#### Step 1: Revenue collection

All gas fees from transactions on Linea are paid in ETH and automatically collected into a revenue 
vault contract. This happens continuously as users interact with the network—every swap, transfer, 
NFT mint, or smart contract interaction contributes to this pool.

#### Step 2: Covering infrastructure costs

Running a high-performance layer 2 network has real costs:
- **Onchain costs**: Submitting transaction data to Ethereum L1, finalizing proofs, bridge 
  transactions (anchoring and claiming)
- **Offchain costs**: Running the mainnet infrastructure (servers, databases, monitoring systems)

Once calculated, an invoice is submitted to the revenue vault. The vault automatically pays what it 
can from available funds. If there's not enough balance, it tracks the outstanding amount (called 
"arrears") and pays it off when more revenue comes in.

Infrastructure costs are always paid first. Burns only happen when there's surplus revenue.

#### Step 3: The burn operation

Once costs are covered and there's surplus revenue available, the burn operation is triggered by a 
service operated by the Linea Consortium on a regular basis:

##### ETH Burn (20%)

The vault takes 20% of the available surplus and sends it directly to the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000). 
This ETH is permanently removed from circulation; it can never be recovered or used again.

##### LINEA Burn (80%)

The remaining 80% goes through a more complex process:
1. **Swap**: The ETH is swapped for LINEA tokens using a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Linea. 
  This creates buying pressure on LINEA and happens at the current market rate with slippage 
  protection to prevent unfavorable trades.
2. **Bridge**: The LINEA tokens are then bridged from Linea (L2) to Ethereum (L1) using Linea's 
  native token bridge. They're sent to a special burner contract on L1.
3. **Burn**: On Ethereum L1, the LINEA tokens are permanently burned. This is important because 
  LINEA's total supply is tracked on L1, so burning must happen there to properly reduce the 
  circulating supply.

The bridging and burning on L1 is designed to be permissionless: anyone can trigger the final burn 
step, ensuring the process can't be blocked or censored.

#### Step 4: Transparency

Every step of this process is recorded onchain:
- Invoice submissions with exact cost amounts and time periods
- Burn operations with precise amounts of ETH and LINEA destroyed
- Bridge transactions showing LINEA moving from L2 to L1
- Final burn transactions on Ethereum L1

You can verify everything yourself by checking the blockchain. The [**live dashboard**](https://dune.com/linea/burn-metrics) 
makes it easy to track:
- Total gas fees collected
- Total ETH burned since September 11, 2024
- Total LINEA burned since September 11, 2024
- Daily burn amounts for both tokens
- Historical trends and charts
