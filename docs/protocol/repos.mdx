Linea is open source, meaning you can inspect the code yourself. 

This page describes each repository that hosts the Linea software and its purpose.

## [`linea-monorepo`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo)

The principal Linea repository. This includes the:

- Coordinator: responsible for multiple orchestrations
- Linea-Besu plugins: to support the sequencer, tracer, and RPC nodes
- Postman: for executing cross-chain messages
- Prover: in charge of generating ZK proofs
- Sequencer: responsible for ordering, building, and executing blocks
- Smart contracts: covering Linea's core functions

## [`linea-specification`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-specification)

Specification of the constraint system underlying Linea's zkEVM.

Constraints are mathematical equations and a constraint system is a collection of such equations. 
Linea's constraint system aims to capture the logic of valid EVM executions.

The constraints specified here are implemented in the `linea-constraints` repo.

## [`linea-constraints`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-constraints)

Implementation of the constraint system specified in the `linea-specification` repo.

Linea's constraint system applies to so-called "traces", which are large matrices of fixed width 
(that is, a fixed number of columns or "registries") and variable depth (correlating with the complexity 
of the EVM execution). The production of such traces is the job of the `linea-tracer` repo.

Constraints and traces are two of the inputs to the prover.

## [`linea-tracer`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-tracer)

Linea-Besu plugin which produces the traces that the constraint system applies and that serve as inputs to the prover.

Tracing refers to the process of extracting data from the execution of an EVM client in order to 
construct large matrices known as execution traces. Execution traces are subject to the constraint 
system specified in the `linea-specification` repo and implemented in the `linea-constraints` repo.

## [`linea-besu-upstream`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu-upstream)

A Besu build configured for Linea.

[Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/) is an Ethereum client that supports [Linea as a named network](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/reference/cli/options#network), with optional plugins for additional functionality.

As Linea is EVM-equivalent, it is compatible with [standard Ethereum clients](../network/how-to/run-a-node/index.mdx). 

## [`gnark`](https://github.com/Consensys/gnark)

Linea's zk-SNARK with a high-level API to design circuits and efficient cryptographic primitives.

## [`shomei`](https://github.com/Consensys/shomei)

A plugin that extends Besu's functionality by maintaining and updating Linea's state. 

## [`maru`](https://github.com/Consensys/maru)

Linea's consensus layer client, implementing the QBFT consensus algorithm.
