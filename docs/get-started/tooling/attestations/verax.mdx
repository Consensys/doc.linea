Verax is a shared onchain attestation registry. The teams that are actively involved in designing 
and building the project include Consensys (the team behind Linea), Clique, Karma3 Labs, Aspecta, 
Primus Labs, and Reclaim Protocol. A number of other teams including GitCoin are building 
integrations with the system.

**_It is not an EIP, a protocol, or a product, but a simple primitive that can be used by any dapps 
and protocols as a shared “data lake” of public data. In essence, it can be thought of as a backend 
or a database._**

Think of Verax as a distribution channel where issuers of attestations keep the attestations. Any 
protocol, dapp, or user that wants to use those attestations can easily use and compose attestations 
from the different sources that are available in that distribution channel. Examples of some of the 
integrations currently being built include Clique, GitCoin, Primus Labs and Reclaim Protocol.

## Use cases

Verax can enable a wide range of use cases, including:

- Inclusive sybil resistance: dapps can have a high degree of confidence that their users are not 
bots _without_ prescribing a narrow method of proving their humanity, which can impose a 
prerequisite on new users and introduce friction into the user experience. Imagine having a 
bot-resistant Lens profile creation system without whitelists, based on sophisticated reputation 
protocols.
- Supporting a market for under-collateralized peer-to-peer lending based on robust, transparent 
and continually evolving reputation scores.
- Permissionless fraud detection and scam prevention: smart contracts and dapps can prove they are 
audited and can have a reputation based on usage and reviews, etc.
- A powerful recommendation engine that allows people to discover new content and dapps that are 
relevant to them, without the need for a centralized curator.

## Proof of Humanity (PoH)

PoH systems ensure that participants in web3 are real humans and not bots. For example, in the 
[Linea DeFi Voyage](https://linea.mirror.xyz/Y7Co9H1-oV0O51nKYW0eFPZSs2xn--YJ2wRJzEecN6o) these 
systems were run by our partners such as Gitcoin, Clique, and Aspecta, leveraging the Verax registry. 
End-users don't directly interact with Verax at any point.

PoH is available as a public API, and can also be checked onchain. See our [guide](../../how-to/poh-api.mdx) 
for more information.
