[Primus](https://primuslabs.xyz/) is a cryptography-based attestation protocol to bring all 
internet data into smart contracts. Primus relies heavily on cryptography to minimize trust, 
and enables end users to prove the correctness of their personal web data in a privacy-preserving 
manner.

The core techniques used in Primus include secure multi-party computation (MPC) and interactive 
zero-knowledge proofs (IZK). End users run Primus client apps to attest their personal web data, and 
create related data proofs with the help of Primus nodes. These data proofs are cryptographically 
verified attestations with security guarantees including:

- Data authenticity: the user web data is honestly retrieved from the indicated data source, and 
the integrity is secured by MPC-TLS and IZK techniques.
- Privacy: When coupled with specific application logic, users' sensitive information is 
well-protected under the zero-knowledge property.

The MPC-TLS and IZK techniques are general enough for both data source integration and data 
computation. For instance, you can create your own attestations including but not limited to:

- Proofs of CEX assets, e.g., Alice has more than 1000 USD for her total token values in Coinbase;
- Proofs of specific token holding, e.g., Alice holds more than 2 ETH in Binance;
- Proofs of nationality, e.g., Alice is a verified bank user with British nationality;
- Proofs of a heavy gamer, e.g., Bob plays more than 10 hours per day on Steam games.

## For developers

The Primus team is creating a template-based SDK (in progress) for developers to build their own 
applications using Primus's off-chain attestation capabilities. The SDK will encapsulate the details 
of underlying cryptographic algorithms and protocols, and provide high-level interfaces for 
application developers to manage the data retrieval and data computation. Developers can leverage 
the SDK in two aspects:

- Use the data source templates to integrate with any preferred Internet data source, and to attest
the corresponding type of data.
- Define and implement their own application logic by integrating with data consumption templates.

## Networks

Primus is deployed on Linea, and integrated with [Verax](https://github.com/Consensys/verax-documentation), 
a public attestation registry to store and manage attestation data that can be accessed by any 
party. This means Primus users can submit these data proofs to Linea via Verax, which can be further 
accessed by other dapps. The following contract address is the Primus portal contract:

| Network | Contract address |
| --- | --- |
| Linea Mainnet | [`0x50bd377EB8D4236Bb587AB3FB1eeafd888AEeC58`](https://lineascan.build/address/0x50bd377EB8D4236Bb587AB3FB1eeafd888AEeC58) |
