## Social Login

[Arcana Auth SDK](https://arcana.network/auth) enables web3 developers to onboard app users quickly via [social login](https://docs.arcana.network/concepts/social-login). It enables the in-app, non-custodial [Arcana wallet](https://docs.arcana.network/concepts/anwallet/) for authenticated users to sign blockchain transactions. 

To get started, see the [Auth Quickstart Guide](https://docs.arcana.network/quick-start/) and follow the steps to integrate Web3 app. Use the appropriate SDK flavor as per your [app type](https://docs.arcana.network/sdk-installation). 

## In-app Arcana wallet

The [Arcana wallet](https://docs.arcana.network/concepts/anwallet/) is a built-in, in-app, non-custodial, wallet available via the [Arcana Auth SDK](https://docs.arcana.network/concepts/authsdk). It is available for [web, mobile, and gaming apps](https://docs.arcana.network/sdk-installation). 

The Linea chain is available out of the box for Web3 app users via the in-app Arcana wallet. It is pre-configured in the blockchain network list. Developers can select it as the [default chain](https://docs.arcana.network/setup/config-dapp-with-db/) by using the [Arcana Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.arcana.network/). 

The users of apps integrated with the Arcana Auth SDK don't need to install a browser extension to use the Arcana wallet or switch to Linea chain. When a user logs into the app, they can instantly access the Arcana wallet and sign blockchain transactions on Linea which is automatically selected as the active chain. This simplifies UX and speeds up app onboarding.

Developers can tailor the user experience of signing blockchain transactions. Besides the look and 
feel of the wallet, developers can also control the Arcana wallet UI display to sign blockchain 
transactions.

## Enable Arcana Wallet

Users cannot directly access the Arcana wallet as a standalone application. App developers must 
integrate the app with the Arcana Auth SDK and enable users to access the Arcana Wallet within the 
app.

Developers need to follow these steps for integration:

1. **Register the app** with the [Arcana Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.arcana.network/), 
and copy the unique client identifier for the app.
2. **Configure Auth SDK usage** via the dashboard, specify social login options, wallet user 
experience settings, gasless transaction settings, etc.
3. **Download and [install](https://docs.arcana.network/sdk-installation)** the Arcana Auth SDK, integrate the app, and add a single line code to onboard users by using the plug-and-play login ui via the`connect()` method. After a successful user login, *Arcana wallet will automatically display within the app context*, enabling the user to sign blockchain transactions instantly. 

:::note

The in-app Arcana Wallet supports [JSON/RPC calls and web3 wallet operations](https://docs.arcana.network/auth/web3-ops/evm/).
