Web3 devs building on the Linea chain can **onboard users** using the [Arcana Auth SDK](https://arcana.network/auth) through the [social login](https://docs.arcana.network/concepts/social-login) feature. 

The SDK also offers an embedded, non-custodial, built-in web3 wallet, the [Arcana wallet](https://docs.arcana.network/concepts/anwallet/). It allows authenticated users to **sign Linea transactions** within the app context. 

## Onboard users

With Arcana Auth SDK's social login, devs can add a single line of code to onboard users through a plug-and-play login UI via `connect()`. Devs can choose one or more of the available [social login providers and custom login options](https://docs.arcana.network/setup/config-auth/) to manage the user onboarding experience.

            alt="Arcana Social Login Plug & Play UI"
      />
  </div>
</div>

Besides onboarding users, devs can also set up the built-in Arcana wallet to use the preconfigured Linea chain as the default active chain in the wallet. This lets authenticated users access the Arcana wallet and review and sign Linea transactions without manually setting up and configuring a wallet before using the Linea chain.  

To onboard users via social login and enable them to use the Arcana wallet in a web3 app, refer to the [Auth Quickstart Guide](https://docs.arcana.network/quick-start/). 

## Sign Linea transactions

The Arcana wallet is automatically available for signing transactions once a user logs in to any app integrated with the [Arcana Auth SDK](https://docs.arcana.network/concepts/authsdk). To access the wallet users need to only log in to such an app. They can instantly access the in-app Arcana Wallet and issue transactions or perform supported web3 wallet operations. Users don't need to download, install or configure a wallet for using the Linea chain.

## SDK integration

Devs need to follow these *steps* for using social login to onboard users and enabling the Arcana wallet within a web3 app's context:

1. **Register the app** with Arcana Network through the [Arcana Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.arcana.network/), and copy the unique client identifier (**client ID**) for the app displayed in the dashboard.
2. **Configure Auth SDK usage** via the dashboard:
  - Select social login options.
  - Set up *Linea* as the **default active chain** displayed in thd wallet.
  - Specify wallet usage settings, etc.
  - Configure optional Auth SDK usage settings.
3. **Download and install** the appropriate Auth SDK flavor as per the web3 [app type](https://docs.arcana.network/sdk-installation). 
4. **Integrate the app** by using the *client ID* obtained in step 1. Refer to the specific app type [Auth Integration Guide](https://docs.arcana.network/auth/integrate/wagmi/) for details.

:::note

Devs can set up Linea as the [default active chain](https://docs.arcana.network/setup/config-dapp-with-db/) in the wallet. Refer to the dashboard [chain management settings](https://docs.arcana.network/setup/config-wallet-chains/#evm-chains).

Devs can also tailor the user experience of signing blockchain transactions on Linea. Besides the look and feel of the wallet, devs can also manage when the wallet UI is displayed within the app context to sign blockchain 
transactions.

:::note

The in-app Arcana Wallet supports [JSON/RPC calls and web3 wallet operations](https://docs.arcana.network/auth/web3-ops/evm/).

## Wallet access

Users do not need to download a wallet, or configure it to use the Linea chain manually. To access the wallet users must log in to an app that is integrated with the [Arcana Auth SDK](https://arcana.network/auth).

Linea is preconfigured in the blockchain network list displayed in the wallet. Users can sign blockchain transactions within the app context on the Linea chain. This simplifies UX and speeds up user onboarding for a web3 app integrated with the Arcana Auth SDK. 

See [Arcana wallet User Guide](https://docs.arcana.network/user-guides/wallet-ui/) for usage details.
