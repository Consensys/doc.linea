Dynamic provides seamless social login authentication for web3 applications, enabling users to 
create embedded wallets via sign-in with social platforms.

## Supported social providers

Dynamic supports authentication through many popular social platforms:

- Apple
- Coinbase
- Discord
- Epic Games
- Facebook
- Farcaster
- GitHub
- Google
- Line
- Shopify
- Spotify
- Telegram
- TikTok
- Twitch
- X

See the [social providers overview](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/social-providers/overview) for a full 
list of options.

## How social login works

When users choose social authentication, Dynamic handles the complete OAuth flow:

1. User selection: Users click their preferred social provider
2. OAuth redirect: Secure redirect to the chosen social platform  
3. Permission approval: Users approve access on the familiar social platform
4. Account creation: Dynamic creates a user profile linked to their social account

Social login creates a profile for the user, but doesn't automatically create an embedded wallet. 
You can set up your Dynamic widget to automatically create an embedded wallet for the user when they
sign in with social. To turn this on, use the toggle on the "Embedded Wallets" section of the 
"Authentication" section in the dashboard.

## Setup and configuration

### 1. Enable social providers

Configure your social authentication options in the [Dynamic Dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/log-in-user-profile):

1. Navigate to the "Authentication" section in the sidebar of the dashboard, and then find the "Log 
  in and User Profile" section
2. Toggle on your desired social platforms
3. Configure OAuth credentials for each provider (see [step 2](#2-provider-specific-configuration))
4. Customize the authentication flow (popup vs redirect)

If you want to create an embedded wallet for the user's profile, you first need to turn on 
embedded wallets in the "Authentication" section of the dashboard, and then [configure a CORS origin](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/developer-dashboard/security#allowed-cors-origin) to proceed. Embedded wallets need a CORS origin to function.

### 2. Provider-specific configuration

Each social provider requires OAuth configuration, and this process differs depending on which 
platform you want to enable. 

Detailed setup instructions for each provider are available in the [Dynamic docs](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/social-providers/overview).

### 3. SDK integration

With the configuration complete, you can start to integrate the Dynamic widget into your dapp.

First, install the Dynamic SDK:

```bash
npm install @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core
```

Then, configure the Dynamic widget:

```jsx
import { DynamicContextProvider } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
      settings={{
        environmentId: 'your-environment-id',
        social: { strategy: 'popup' }
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app components */}
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

The `social` prop takes either `popup` or `redirect` to determine how the social login flow should
occur.
