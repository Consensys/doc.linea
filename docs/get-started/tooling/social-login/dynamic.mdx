Dynamic provides seamless social login authentication for web3 applications, supporting popular 
platforms including Apple, Discord, Facebook, Farcaster, Github, Google, Telegram, Twitch, and 
Twitter. It bridges the gap between familiar web2 social authentication and web3 functionality, 
making it easier for users to onboard to your Linea applications without the complexity of 
traditional wallet setup.

## Supported social providers

Dynamic supports authentication through many popular social platforms:

- Apple
- Discord
- Facebook
- Farcaster
- Github
- Google
- Telegram
- Twitch
- X

See the [social providers overview](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/social-providers/overview) for a full 
list of options.

## How social login works

When users choose social authentication, Dynamic handles the complete OAuth flow:

1. User selection: Users click their preferred social provider
2. OAuth redirect: Secure redirect to the chosen social platform  
3. Permission approval: Users approve access on the familiar social platform
4. Account creation: Dynamic creates a user profile linked to their social account
5. Wallet generation: An embedded wallet is automatically created for web3 interactions
6. Seamless access: Users can now interact with your Linea dApp

## Setup and configuration

### 1. Enable social providers

Configure your social authentication options in the [Dynamic Dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/log-in-user-profile):

1. Navigate to the "Social Providers" section
2. Toggle on your desired social platforms
3. Configure OAuth credentials for each provider (see provider-specific guides below)
4. Customize the authentication flow (popup vs redirect)

### 2. Provider-specific configuration

Each social provider requires OAuth configuration, and this process differs depending on which 
platform you want to enable. 

Detailed setup instructions for each provider are available in the [Dynamic docs](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/social-providers/overview).

### 3. SDK integration

Install and configure the Dynamic SDK:

```bash
npm install @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core
```

```jsx
import { DynamicContextProvider } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
      settings={{
        environmentId: 'your-environment-id',
        // Customize social authentication behavior
        social: {
          // Use 'popup' for better UX, 'redirect' for mobile compatibility  
          authMode: 'popup'
        }
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app components */}
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

### 4. Customization options

Fine-tune the social login experience:

- Authentication mode: Choose between popup or redirect flows
- Provider selection: Enable only the social platforms relevant to your audience
- UI customization: Match the login interface to your application design
- Post-login flow: Configure what happens after successful social authentication

## Embedded wallets for social users

When users authenticate via social login, Dynamic automatically generates embedded wallets, 
enabling:

- Immediate web3 functionality without additional wallet setup
- Secure key management handled transparently
- Full compatibility with Linea and other EVM networks
- Seamless transition from web2 authentication to web3 interactions

## Best practices

1. Choose relevant providers: Select social platforms that match your target audience
2. Optimize for mobile: Use redirect mode for better mobile compatibility
3. Clear value proposition: Explain why users should connect their social accounts
4. Gradual web3 introduction: Start with familiar social login, introduce web3 features 
   progressively
5. Security considerations: Enable MFA for users handling significant value
