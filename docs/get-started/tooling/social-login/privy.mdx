Privy provides comprehensive social login authentication for web3 applications, enabling users to 
create embedded wallets through familiar social platforms. 

## Supported social providers

Privy supports authentication through many popular social platforms:

- Apple
- Discord
- Farcaster
- GitHub
- Google
- LinkedIn
- Telegram
- TikTok
- X

For X, Privy supports both OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0a authentication flows, providing flexibility 
based on your application's needs.

## How social login works

When users choose social authentication, Privy handles the complete OAuth flow:

1. Provider selection: Users select their preferred social platform
2. OAuth redirect: Secure redirect to the chosen social provider's authentication page
3. Permission approval: Users approve access permissions on the familiar social platform
4. Account creation: Privy creates a user profile linked to their social account
5. Wallet generation: An embedded wallet is automatically created for web3 interactions
6. Token management: Optional OAuth tokens returned for additional API access

## Setup and configuration

### 1. Enable social providers

Configure social authentication in the [Privy Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io):

1. Find the "User management" section in the dashboard sidebar
2. Click on "Authentication"
3. Navigate to the "Socials" tab
4. Toggle on any desired social platforms.

### 2. OAuth credential options

Next to each social provider, you can see a dropdown that enables you to access OAuth configuration.
Privy offers two approaches for OAuth configuration:
- Default credentials: Use Privy's pre-configured OAuth credentials for quick setup and testing. This 
  is perfect for development and getting started quickly.
- Custom credentials: Configure your own OAuth applications for production use. This provides better 
  security, branding control, and eliminates shared rate limits.

See the [Privy guide](https://docs.privy.io/basics/get-started/dashboard/configure-login-methods#configure-your-oauth-credentials) 
to learn how to set up OAuth credentials with each provider.

Benefits of custom credentials:
- Your app branding appears on social login screens
- Better security and application control
- Dedicated rate limits for your application
- Enhanced resiliency and reliability

### 3. SDK integration

With configuration done, you can implement the Privy SDK and widget into your dapp.

First, install the Privy SDK:

```bash
npm install @privy-io/react-auth
```

There are many SDK flavours, depending on which language you're using. 

Now wrap your app in the `PrivyProvider`:

```jsx
import { PrivyProvider } from '@privy-io/react-auth';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <PrivyProvider
      appId="your-privy-app-id"
      config={{
        // Configure which login methods to show
        loginMethods: ['email', 'wallet', 'google', 'twitter', 'discord'],
        // Customize the authentication experience
        appearance: {
          theme: 'light',
          accentColor: '#676FFF',
        },
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app components */}
    </PrivyProvider>
  );
}
```
