Privy provides comprehensive social login authentication for web3 applications, enabling users to 
create embedded wallets through familiar social platforms. 

## Supported social providers

Privy supports authentication through many popular social platforms:

- Apple
- Discord
- Farcaster
- GitHub
- Google
- LinkedIn
- Telegram
- TikTok
- X

For X, Privy supports both OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0a authentication flows, providing flexibility 
based on your application's needs.

## How social login works

When users choose social authentication, Privy handles the complete OAuth flow:

1. Provider selection: Users select their preferred social platform
2. OAuth redirect: Secure redirect to the chosen social provider's authentication page
3. Permission approval: Users approve access permissions on the familiar social platform
4. Account creation: Privy creates a user profile linked to their social account
5. Wallet generation: An embedded wallet is automatically created for web3 interactions
6. Token management: Optional OAuth tokens returned for additional API access

## Setup and configuration

### 1. Enable social providers

Configure social authentication in the [Privy Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io):

1. Navigate to the "Login Methods" page
2. Click on the "Socials" tab
3. Toggle on your desired social platforms
4. Choose between default or custom OAuth credentials

### 2. OAuth credential options

Privy offers two approaches for OAuth configuration:

Default credentials: Use Privy's pre-configured OAuth credentials for quick setup and testing. This 
is perfect for development and getting started quickly.

Custom credentials: Configure your own OAuth applications for production use. This provides better 
security, branding control, and eliminates shared rate limits.

Benefits of custom credentials:
- Your app branding appears on social login screens
- Better security and application control
- Dedicated rate limits for your application
- Enhanced resiliency and reliability

### 3. Provider-specific configuration

Each social provider requires OAuth app setup when using custom credentials:

- Apple: Create App ID, Service ID, and signing key through Apple Developer Console. Note that Apple 
  configuration differs significantly from other providers and requires additional setup steps.
- Discord: Register a developer application and generate OAuth2 credentials through the Discord 
Developer Portal.
- GitHub: Create a GitHub OAuth App (not a GitHub App) through GitHub Developer Settings.
- Google: Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials through Google Cloud Console with proper redirect URIs 
configured.
Telegram: Create a Telegram bot using @BotFather and configure domain settings. Requires bot token 
and handle for authentication.

For all providers, use Privy's OAuth callback endpoint as your redirect URI:
`https://auth.privy.io/api/v1/oauth/callback`

Detailed setup instructions for each provider are available in the [Privy documentation](https://docs.privy.io/basics/get-started/dashboard/configure-login-methods#social-providers).

### 4. SDK integration

Install and configure the Privy SDK:

```bash
npm install @privy-io/react-auth
```

```jsx
import { PrivyProvider } from '@privy-io/react-auth';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <PrivyProvider
      appId="your-privy-app-id"
      config={{
        // Configure which login methods to show
        loginMethods: ['email', 'wallet', 'google', 'twitter', 'discord'],
        // Customize the authentication experience
        appearance: {
          theme: 'light',
          accentColor: '#676FFF',
        },
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app components */}
    </PrivyProvider>
  );
}
```

### 5. Advanced features

- Token access: Enable "Return OAuth tokens" to receive user OAuth and refresh tokens for making 
authenticated API calls to social platforms.
- Custom scopes: Configure additional OAuth scopes beyond the default permissions to access more 
granular user data or enable write operations.
- Farcaster integration: Automatically link connected wallets when users log in with Farcaster 
accounts, enabling seamless web3 social experiences.
- X flexibility: Choose between OAuth 2.0 (simpler, app-wide rate limits) or OAuth 1.0a 
(user-specific rate limits, broader API access) based on your needs.


## Security

- Multi-factor authentication: Privy recommends enabling MFA alongside social login for enhanced 
security, especially for applications handling significant value.
- Token security: OAuth and refresh tokens are highly sensitive. Store them securely and follow best 
practices for token management if you enable token return features.
- Telegram bot security: Your Telegram bot token acts as a symmetric key for authentication. Secure 
this key properly as compromise puts all Telegram users at risk.
- Rate limiting: Consider OAuth 1.0a for X if you expect high authentication volumes to avoid 
app-wide rate limit issues.
