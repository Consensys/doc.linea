Web3 has lost trust and faith due to frequent hacks, resulting in billions of dollars lost, while 
existing security solutions continue to fall short. Auditing is not scalable, and monitoring is 
often too late. Both fail to provide the comprehensive, continuous protection is needed to defend 
your protocol and instill trust. Protocol owners find themselves having to independently construct 
security measures and components, making it nearly impossible to guarantee certainty and eliminate 
edge cases and malicious activity in their protocol despite substantial efforts and budget.

SphereX's embedded security safeguards your protocol and fortifies your code during execution, 
proactively blocking any exploitative or unexpected behavior. SphereX's solution is designed as a 
modular platform, facilitating the seamless onboarding of diverse capabilities. Features like 
compliance, circuit breakers, virtual patching, investigations, and more can be seamlessly added at 
any stage during your protocol's lifecycle. The modular nature allows the protocol to evolve in 
tandem with tasks and requirements. SphereX's platform guarantees that any attempt to interact with 
the protocol beyond the intended boundaries will be promptly intercepted and reversed.
