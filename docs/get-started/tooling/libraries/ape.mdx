Ape Framework is an easy-to-use web3 development tool. Users can compile, test,
and interact with smart contracts, all in one command line session. With a
modular plugin system, Ape supports multiple contract languages and chains,
including Linea.

Ape is built by [ApeWorX LTD](https://apeworx.io/).

The Linea team developed the [plugin to add Linea support to Ape](https://github.com/Consensys/ape-linea).

See the [Ape docs](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/index.html) for more
information.
