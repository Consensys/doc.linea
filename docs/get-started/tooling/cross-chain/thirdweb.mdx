Want to see how Universal Bridge works? Check it out under the hood with this example:

```jsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { PayEmbed } from "thirdweb/react";

import { createWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { linea } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: "....",
});

function Example() {
  return (
    <PayEmbed
      client={client}
      payOptions={{
        mode: "fund_wallet",
        prefillBuy: {
          chain: linea,
          amount: "0.01",
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}

```
