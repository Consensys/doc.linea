[Axelar](https://docs.axelar.dev/) is a blockchain of blockchains that allows 
for universal web3 interoperability. By integrating with Axelar, your 
Linea-based application now has access to the [45+ chains](https://axelarscan.io/) 
that are also connected via Axelar. As Axelar is a blockchain of blockchains, it 
overcomes many of the challenges of more centralized interoperability solutions;
transactions that go through the Axelar network cannot be censored by any oracle, 
relayer, or sequencer.

## Functionality

Axelar enables interchain features for builders on Linea:

1. [Send tokens](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/send-tokens/overview) across 
blockchains
2. [Send general messages](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/overview) 
across blockchains

## Linea integration

When integrating with Axelar there are two key contracts you must use:

1. The [Axelar Gateway](https://docs.axelar.dev/learn#gateway-smart-contracts)
   - On the source chain, this contract exposes the functions which you will use 
   to initiate an interchain transaction.
   - On the destination chain, this contract enables messages to be executed 
   automatically to complete the interchain transaction.
1. The [Axelar Gas Service](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/gas-services/intro)
   - This contract is the entrypoint into Axelar's gas service, which handles 
   gas payment for your transaction on both the Axelar network and the 
   destination chain. You, as the caller, now only need to cover gas on the 
   source chain.

Once you have submitted your transaction, you can view it on the [Axelarscan 
block explorer](https://axelarscan.io/). The Axelarscan explorer is specifically 
tailored to show your interchain transaction step-by-step as it passes from the 
source chain, via the Axelar network, to the destination chain.

## Linea-Axelar example

For a full end-to-end example of a Linea-Axelar integration, check out our 
[video walkthrough](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-KgJZmq8Umc&t=1s) of the 
process. The complementary code can be found [here](https://github.com/Olanetsoft/linea-interchain-workshop-with-axelar).

## Axelar use cases

For inspiration, here are some live use cases demonstrating the kind of 
interchain applications that can be built on top of Axelar:

1. Interchain token swaps (e.g. [Squid](https://app.squidrouter.com/))

   - Squid is a new protocol built on top of Axelar that allows users to swap 
   tokens with a Uniswap-like experience, leveraging Axelar for swaps between 
   tokens across different blockchains. Squid reduces the need to revert to 
   centralized exchanges or multiple different exchanges to swap tokens across 
   chains.

2. Interchain lending (e.g. [Prime Protocol](https://primeprotocol.xyz/))

   - A chain-agnostic prime brokerage that allows users to deposit assets from 
   any connected chain and use their aggregate value as collateral for loans on 
   any other connected chain. Prime offers the ability to build interchain 
   applications that connect from any blockchain to any other blockchain, rather 
   than just connecting a series of blockchains to Ethereum. This interchain 
   design allows for a variety of new DeFi use cases, including cross-chain 
   margining.

3. Interchain gaming (e.g. [Junkyard](https://junkyard.wtf/))

   - Web3 gaming is heavily reliant on NFTs, and enabling NFTs to be passed 
   between blockchains is a critical next step for NFT-based games. Junkyard 
   leverages Axelar for interchain NFTs: players can deposit their NFTs to the 
   Junkyard contract. The NFT can come from any chain connected to the Axelar 
   ecosystem, including Linea.
