Chainlink CCIP is a blockchain interoperability protocol that enables developers to build secure 
applications that can transfer tokens, messages (data), or both tokens and messages across chains.

CCIP enables three main actions:
- **Arbitrary messaging**: Send arbitrary data (encoded as bytes) to a receiving smart contract on 
a different chain.
- **Token transfers**: Transfer tokens to a smart contract or an externally owned account (EOA).
- **Programmable token transfers**: Simultaneously transfer tokens and arbitrary data in a single
transaction.

To use CCIP services, you need to have LINK available to pay node operators, a cost referred to as
CCIP fees. [See the token contracts for LINK on Linea](https://docs.chain.link/resources/link-token-contracts#linea).
