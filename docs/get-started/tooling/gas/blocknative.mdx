Blocknative offers APIs to help developers and users estimate fees on Linea. The estimates are based 
on real-time Linea data and ML modeling to accurately and consistently estimate Linea transaction 
fees. Linea fee estimation is also available in the Blocknative [browser extension](https://blocknative.com/gas-extension).

## Use the Blocknative Gas API

To leverage Blocknative's Gas API, you will need an [API Key](https://docs.blocknative.com/gas-prediction/gas-platform). 
Once you have an API key, you can request fee estimation for Linea:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: your-apikey-here" https://api.blocknative.com/gasprices/blockprices?chainid=59144
```
