description: Tenderly offers specialized RPC methods for Linea blockchain developers to accurately estimate gas usage and predict optimal gas prices for upcoming blocks with probability-based transaction inclusion rates.
---

Tenderly provides RPC methods to help developers estimate gas usage for a transaction, and predict gas price for the next block:

- estimate gas on Linea with 100% accuracy with [`tenderly_estimateGas`](https://docs.tenderly.co/node/rpc-reference/linea/tenderly_estimateGas?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=linea) RPC method. This method estimates gas by profiling the transaction, and Tenderly ensures entire transaction runs fully, regardless of the initially provided gas for said transaction.
- predict gas prices for the next block using [`tenderly_gasPrice`](https://docs.tenderly.co/node/rpc-reference/linea/tenderly_gasPrice?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=linea) RPC method. Gas price prediction is based on historical data and statistical analysis, and it comes in 3 probability levels for transaction inclusion in the next block, including `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, and transaction `waitTime`.

## Use the Tenderly Gas API

To leverage Tenderly's Gas API, create an RPC Node and call the RPC methods:


**`tenderly_estimateGas`**
```bash
curl https://linea.gateway.tenderly.co/$TENDERLY_NODE_ACCESS_KEY \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "method": "tenderly_estimateGas",
  "params": [
    {
      "from": "0x8516feaea147ea0db64d1c5b97bb651ca5435155",
      "to": "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f",
      "data": "0xa9059cbb0000000000000000000000003fc3c4c84bdd2db5ab2cc62f93b2a9a347de25fb00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001869c36187f3430000",
      "value": "0x0"
    },
    "21285787"
  ]
}'
```

**`tenderly_gasPrice`**
```bash
curl https://linea.gateway.tenderly.co/$TENDERLY_NODE_ACCESS_KEY \
    -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 0,
        "method": "tenderly_gasPrice"
    }'
```
