Alchemy Subgraphs is a blockchain indexing platform with drop-in support for
hosted subgraphs.

Subgraphs are an open-source tool for building custom GraphQL APIs from on-chain
data.

Identify on-chain events you want to index, write AssemblyScript handlers to
transform them into your preferred format, and let the subgraph automatically
ingest new events for you immediately as they happen.

## Why subgraphs?

Developing an in-house indexing system is time-consuming, expensive, and
requires ongoing expertise in data pipelines, devOps, and more.

Subgraphs handle the intricacies of data ingestion, decoding, and database
management for you. Just define the data format you want and query live data
through a GraphQL API.

## Why Alchemy Subgraphs?

- **Simple and reliable.** We make payment easy (just a credit card, no staking
  tokens) and have guaranteed uptime.
- **Developer tooling.** Access developer tools like error logs, subgraph
  versioning, indexing performance metrics, and more.
- **Easy migration.** If you have existing subgraphs, it takes just 5 minutes to
  switch over using the familiar command line tools.
