Sentio is an integrated, hosted, and modern analytics, monitoring, alerting, and
debugging tool for decentralized applications.

You can use Sentio's SDK to collect and transform [metrics](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/metrics) 
and [event logs](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/event-logs) generated based on 
their smart contracts' events, transactions, traces and states. Sentio fully 
manages the indexing process, and users can visualize data in the [dashboard](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/dashboard), 
set up [alerts](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/alerts), perform advanced search on 
the logs, and dig into a transaction via [Sentio debugger](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/debugger-overview), 
all via Sentio's web interface.
