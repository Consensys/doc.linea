As web3 platforms, protocols, and dapps become more mainstream, there is an
increasing demand for these companies to know their users' behaviors and
connections. Having a partner that can help companies and developers understand
their users better is important for Linea and its mission to provide better
scalability.

This article provides information on using Scopescan and its analytical tools to
determine authentic users and their relations on Linea.

## Scopescan and its value

Understanding web3 users' patterns can be difficult, especially given that any
particular user can have multiple addresses and that web3 prioritizes privacy.
Unlike their web2 counterparts, web3 companies understandably have additional
hurdles to clear to fine-tune their products to users' evolving needs. This is
where Scopescan brings unique value to the Linea platform and its projects.

Scopescan is an onchain data analytics platform that allows the creation of
real-time profiles, called entities, with meaningful connections. It features an
extensive list of analytical tools that are built on user-based data and powered
by the 0xScope web3 AI Data Layer, for high-quality data extraction and
processing that meets the high data standards of AI solutions.

When Scopescan added Linea to its lineup of supported blockchains, it looked
into all the addresses of this chain and the relationships between these
addresses. This way, Scopescan users will be able to see the behavior of any
user on the Linea chain, and then discover connections between these users. When
Linea ecosystem projects leverage this entity-related information, they can
understand their users better and fine-tune their strategies to grow their user
base.

## Scopescan's analytical tools

Scopescan is equipped with a variety of tools that help the Linea community
better understand users, projects, and their interconnections. Here are the
three categories through which Scopescan's lineup of tools are categorized:

### 1. Discovery mode

In this mode, Scopescan users can find profiles of the top addresses, tokens,
and projects on Linea. These profile pages are comprehensive dashboards
containing relevant information about any entity on Linea. Below, you can see a
sample dashboard for Linea's projects and addresses.

      />
  </div>

### 2. Alpha hunting

This segment of Scopescan contains dashboards focused on identifying potential
alpha opportunities related to tokens and projects in the Linea ecosystem. The
Live Statistics dashboard (shown in the first picture below) displays statistics
such as active users, top gas spenders and consumers, and CEX activity on
Linea-supported tokens. There are other dashboards dedicated to whales, VCs, and
institutions affiliated with the Linea ecosystem. The second picture below is an
example of the Whale Watch dashboard.

In addition, you can create your own dashboard that can track specific addresses
on your radar, giving you a key advantage in tracking changes in user behaviors
and acting upon them.

      />
  </div>
</div>

### 3. Investigation mode

Under Investigation Mode, there are several tools focused on transactions and
token analytics. For instance, the Address Clustering tool (first picture below)
allows you to generate an address graph that visualizes likely connected
addresses, based on a search for a single address. Meanwhile, the Money Flow
tool (second picture below) allows users to investigate, track and share
relevant information on blockchain transactions.
