[Envio](https://envio.dev/) is a customizable, real-time indexing solution that
provides developers with a seamless, efficient way to index and aggregate
blockchain data. The indexed data is accessible through GraphQL queries,
providing developers with the ability to flexibly retrieve specific information.

Envio offers native support for Linea (both testnet and mainnet) and has been
designed to support high-throughput blockchain applications that rely on
real-time data for their business requirements.

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code
generation, flexible language support, quickstart templates, and a reliable,
cost-effective hosted service.

Indexers on Envio can be written in JavaScript, TypeScript, or ReScript.

## Envio HyperSync

Envio offers support for [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hypersync) on
Linea Mainnet.

HyperSync is an indexed layer of the Linea blockchain, providing accelerated
APIs (JSON-RPC bypass) for fast historical data syncing. Developers do not need
to worry about RPC URLs, rate-limited APIs, or managing infrastructure, and can
sync large datasets in a few minutes, something that would usually take 20x
longer via JSON-RPC.

## Other features

- Fully customizable to meet your unique data needs.
- Aggregate data from multi-chain/cross-chain deployments into a unified GraphQL
  API (or REST API).
- Detailed logging and error messaging for effective troubleshooting and
  debugging.
- Quickstart templates with pre-defined indexing logic for popular OpenZeppelin
  contracts (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, etc.)

## Get started

The following files are required from the user to run the Envio indexer:

- Configuration (defaults to `config.yaml`)
- GraphQL Schema (defaults to `schema.graphql`)
- Event Handlers (defaults to `src/EventHandlers.*` depending on the language
  chosen)

These files are auto-generated according to the template and language chosen by
running the `envio init` command.

> [See our **quickstart guide**.](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/quickstart)

```bash
? Would you like to start from a template or migrate from a subgraph?
> "Template"
  "SubgraphMigration"
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]

```

Then choose a template out of the possible options:

```bash
? Which template would you like to use?
> "Blank"
  "Greeter"
  "ERC-20"
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

Then choose a language from **Javascript**, **Typescript**, or **Rescript** to
write the event handlers file.

```bash
? Which language would you like to use?
> "Javascript"
  "Typescript"
  "Rescript"
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

This will create the config, schema and event handlers files according to the
template and language chosen.
