Real-time and historical custom data indexing for any evm chain.

[Flair](https://flair.dev) offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as
fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors, re-org aware database
integrations) for receiving, transforming, storing, and accessing your onchain
data.

## Why Flair?

- 🚀 A **parallel and distributed processing paradigm**, rather than constrained
  sequential processing, supports your indexing stack's scalability and
  resiliency.
- 🧩 Focused on **primitives**, which means on the left you plug in an RPC and
  on the right you output the data to any destination database.
- 🚄 Native **real-time stream processing** for certain data workloads (such as
  aggregations, rollups) for things like total volume per pool, or total
  portfolio per user wallet.
- ☁️ **Managed** cloud services avoid DevOps and irrelevant engineering costs
  for dapp developers.
- 🧑‍💻 Avoid decentralization **overhead** (consensus, network hops, etc.). We
  believe the best UX for dapps reading data must be as close to the developers
  as possible.

## Features

- ✅ Listen to **any EVM chain** with just an RPC URL.
  - Free managed RPC URLs for 8+ popular chains already included.
  - Works with both websocket and https-only RPCs.
- ✅ Track and ingest **any contract** for **any event topic.**
  - Auto-track new contracts deployed from factory contracts.
- ✅ **Custom processor scripts** with Javascript runtime (with **Typescript**
  support)
  - Make external API or Webhook calls to third-party or your backend.
  - Get current or historical USD value of any ERC-20 token amount of any
    contract address on any chain.
  - Use any external NPM library.
- ✅ **Stream** any stored data to your destination database (Postgres, MongoDB,
  MySQL, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Timescale, etc).

## Get started

1. Clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate)
   template and follow the instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate.git
# ... follow instructions in README.md
```

:::info

Boilerplate instructions will create a **new cluster**, generate **an API Key**,
and set up a `manifest.yml` to index your **first contract** with **sample
custom processor** scripts.

Learn more about the [structure of `manifest.yml`](https://docs.flair.dev/reference/manifest.yml).

:::

2. Configure Linea RPC nodes. Set a unique namespace, Linea `chainId` and RPC
   endpoint in your `config`. Remember that you can add up to 10 RPC endpoints
   for resiliency.

```yaml
{
  "cluster": "dev",
  "namespace": "my-awesome-linea-indexing-dev",
  "indexers":
    [
      {
        "chainId": 59140,
        "enabled": true,
        "ingestionFilterGroup": "default",
        "processingFilterGroup": "default",
        "sources": [
            # Having at least 1 websocket endpoint is highly recommended
            "wss://linea-mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxxx",
            "https://linea-mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxxx",
            # You can add multiple endpoints for failover
            "https://rpc.linea.build",
          ],
      },
    ],
}
```

3. Sync some historical data using the [`backfill` command](https://docs.flair.dev/reference/backfilling).
Remember that the `enabled: true` flag in your `config` already enables your
indexer to capture data in real-time.

```bash
# backfill certain contracts or block ranges
pnpm flair backfill --chain 59140 --address 0x0872ec4426103482a50f26ffc32acefcec61b3c9 -d backward --max-blocks 10000
# backfill for a specific block number, if you have certain events you wanna test with
pnpm flair backfill --chain 59140 -b 409652
# backfill for the recent data in the last X minute
pnpm flair backfill --chain 59140 --min-timestamp="30 mins ago" -d backward
```

4. [Query](https://docs.flair.dev/#getting-started) your custom indexed data.

5. Stream the data to your [own database](https://docs.flair.dev/reference/database#your-own-database).
