The Biconomy SDK provides solutions for decentralized applications (dapps) that streamline and 
simplify tasks from onboarding to user engagement while respecting self-custody. It is a one-stop 
solution to reduce friction in your dapp: it eases onboarding for new users and abstracts away 
transaction complexities that your users face on a daily basis. This is enabled by using Smart 
Contract Wallets (SCW) built on top of our multi-chain Relayer Infrastructure.
