## Account abstraction infrastructure built for web3 games

[Openfort](https://openfort.xyz) is an infrastructure provider that simplifies the development of 
games and gamified experiences with a suite of API endpoints. The platform vertically integrates 
the AA stack with a network of paymasters and bundlers, enabling game developers to focus on 
development without worrying about private key management, the account model or onchain interactions.

Openfort is powered by [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551) and [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337).
