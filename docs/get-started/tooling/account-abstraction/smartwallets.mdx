thirdweb's Smart Wallet SDK allows you to implement EIP-4337-compliant smart contract-enabled 
accounts on Linea, and leverages Pimlico infrastructure for Bundler and Paymaster.

A smart contract-enabled account, or _smart account_, is a type of web3 account that can be 
customized and managed by smart contracts.

This smart account is unlocked by a private key. This key can be held in MetaMask, on your local 
machine, or elsewhere, and is used as a way to 'sign in' to the account.

## Benefits

1. Optimized transaction efficiency and transaction batching
2. Combine multiple transactions into a single transaction to save on gas fees
3. Improved security features
4. Social and multi-sig recovery
5. Recover an account without seed phrases/passwords
6. Nominate a trusted person to recover your account in the case of an emergency

## Use cases:

As a dapp developer, you may want to control the user experience from the onboarding phase and 
embed a smart wallet in your dapp by default. thirdweb's Smart Wallet SDK enables this with 
low-code, Node.js, and React templates.
