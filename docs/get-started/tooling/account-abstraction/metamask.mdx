The MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit enables you to create and manage MetaMask Smart Accounts.
One of the core features of MetaMask Smart Accounts is the ability to grant permission to another
smart account or externally owned account (EOA) to perform specific executions on its behalf.

The Smart Accounts Kit supports two types of smart accounts, each offering unique features
and use cases.

## Hybrid smart account

The Hybrid smart account is a flexible implementation that supports both an externally 
owned account (EOA) "owner" and any number of P256 (passkey) signers.
See [the MetaMask docs page](https://docs.metamask.io/smart-accounts-kit/guides/smart-accounts/create-smart-account/#create-a-hybrid-smart-account) for more information.

## Multisig smart account

The Multisig smart account is an implementation that supports multiple signers with a configurable threshold 
for valid signatures, allowing for enhanced security and flexibility in account management. 
See [the MetaMask docs page](https://docs.metamask.io/smart-accounts-kit/guides/smart-accounts/create-smart-account/#create-a-multisig-smart-account) for more information.


See the [Smart Accounts Kit documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/smart-accounts-kit/get-started/smart-account-quickstart/) to learn more.
