## Solutions

At Umbrella, we are committed to providing simple solutions for using offchain 
data onchain. We understand that different projects have unique requirements. 
That's why we offer several ways to consume data:

### Onchain data

For projects that need their custom data feeds onchain, with defined parameters 
such as deviation triggers and heartbeat. This solution is suitable for vault 
tokens, volatility monitoring, TWAPs, and more. 

These are the price feeds available on Linea Mainnet and their configuration:

- ETH-USD
  - Deviation threshold: 0.5%
  - Heartbeat: 1 hour
- USDT-USD
  - Deviation threshold: 1%
  - Heartbeat: 6 hours
- USDC-USD
  - Deviation threshold: 1%
  - Heartbeat: 6 hours

> You can expect some delays on the update of the price feeds on chain as 
validators on the Umbrella Network complete their upgrades.

If you need another price feed, [contact us](https://www.umb.network/contact#form).

Umbrella's Registry contract address on Linea.

### Layer 2 data

For projects that need data secured onchain at scale, our layer 2 data solution 
is the answer. Whether you're in the DeFi space, prediction markets, or 
building data-heavy web3 solutions, we ensure your data is secure and readily 
available to support your applications.

### On-demand data

For projects that require high-frequency data. Signed offchain data can be 
written into any smart contract on demand. This feature is suitable for 
high-frequency perpetual futures or spot-trading platforms where timing is 
crucial. Access the data you need, precisely when you need it.
