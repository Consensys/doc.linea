Rather than just providing arbitrary price data, the Tellor oracle is a protocol 
for answering verifiable onchain queries of any format. The Tellor protocol 
incentivizes an open, permissionless network of data reporting and data 
validation, ensuring that data can be provided by anyone and checked by everyone.
Built for any data type, our network of reporters supports your basic spot 
prices, more sophisticated pricing specs (TWAP/VWAP), RNG, or any custom data 
needs you have. If your data can be verified, Tellor can bring it onchain.

## How it works

The oracle mechanism works by using simple crypto-economic incentives to secure 
data through staking and dispute mechanisms, while the protocol is bound by a 
token which utilizes governance and monetary incentives to reward data reporters 
and development of the network.

At a high level, Tellor is an oracle system where a bonded set of “reporters” 
answer questions onchain for others to use freely. To create a properly 
incentivized system, Tellor mints a native token, “Tributes” (TRB). Rewards in 
TRB incentivize reporters to submit data using peer-to-peer payments. Using TRB, 
parties can “tip” a specific question or “query” they want updated, then 
reporters can choose whether the reward for fetching the data is worth the cost 
of placing the value onchain. The security of Tellor comes through a deposit of 
TRB that acts as a bond or stake requirement in order for reporters to 
participate in providing data. The reporters risk losing this stake if they 
submit data that is successfully disputed.

## Get started

Use the [UsingTellor](https://github.com/tellor-io/usingtellor) helper contract
to use Tellor data. After connecting it to the oracle you can read a value using 
your `queryid`. Follow the guides in our [documentation](https://docs.tellor.io) 
for further instruction.

## Request data feeds

Tellor's network of data reporters already actively supports a large variety of 
price/data feeds and adding new ones upon request can happen with a quick 
turnaround. You can even do it permissionlessly. For both price feed requests 
and non-price/custom feeds, anyone can submit a data specification and get their 
query supported by Tellor.
