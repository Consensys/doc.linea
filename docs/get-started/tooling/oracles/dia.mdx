## Request a custom oracle

[DIA](https://diadata.org/) offers customizable oracles tailored to each
dapp's needs. Each oracle can be customized in several ways, including data
sources, data cleansing filters, pricing and computational methodologies, update
mechanisms and more. This ensures that the data and oracle remain robust and
resilient to the market conditions and provide a global market price as well as
specific individual or cross-chain market prices.

By collecting billions of raw trades directly from over 90 sources, including
CEXs, DEXs, and NFT marketplaces, DIA enables full transparency, customization,
and control throughout the entire value stack. DIA's data and oracle suite
comprise price feeds for 20,000+ assets including cryptocurrencies, NFT
collections, and liquid-staked tokens, as well as random number generation and
other data feed types.

## Token price feeds

DIA token price feeds provide smart contracts with real-time price information
for [3,000+ cryptocurrencies](https://diadata.org/app/price), sourced
transparently from [90+ trusted, high-volume DEXs and CEXs](https://diadata.org/app/source/defi).

## Access DIA oracles

Here is an example of how to access a price value on DIA oracles:

1. Access your custom oracle smart contract on Linea.
2. Use the "Read" section on the explorer to execute the `getValue(pair_name)`
call, where `pair_name` is the full pair name such as `BTC/USD`.
3. The response of the call contains two values:
    - The current asset price in USD with a fix-comma notation of 8 decimals.
    - The UNIX timestamp of the last oracle update.

## Linea demo price oracles

We have deployed the following demo oracles for the Linea community. They
provide a limited selection of cryptocurrency price feeds with predefined
configuration settings.

:::note
DIA demo oracles are not intended for use in production environments. For a
dedicated, production-ready oracle with custom price feeds and configuration
settings, [request a custom oracle](https://docs.diadata.org/introduction/intro-to-dia-oracles/request-an-oracle).
