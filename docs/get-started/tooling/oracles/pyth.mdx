Pyth Network is an oracle that publishes financial market data to multiple
blockchains. Our market data is contributed by over 80 [first-party publishers](https://pyth.network/publishers), including major exchanges and market making firms. We offer price feeds for a number of
different asset classes, including [US equities, commodities, and 
cryptocurrencies](https://pyth.network/price-feeds). Each price feed publishes a
[robust aggregate](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/how-pyth-works/price-aggregation)
of publisher prices that updates multiple times per second.

## How Pyth works

Pyth allows market participants to publish pricing information onchain for
others to use. The protocol is an interaction between three parties:

- _Publishers_ submit pricing information to Pyth's oracle program. Pyth has
  multiple data publishers for every product to improve the accuracy and
  robustness of the system.
- Pyth's _oracle program_ combines publishers' data to produce a single
  aggregate price and confidence interval.
- _Consumers_ read the price information produced by the oracle program.

## Pyth on-demand model

Pyth Network uses a pull price update model that is slightly different from
other oracles you may be more familiar with. Most oracles today use a push
model, where the oracle runs an offchain process that continuously sends
transactions to update an onchain price. In contrast, Pyth Network doesn't
operate an offchain process that pushes prices onchain. Instead, it delegates
this work to Pyth Network users.

Pyth price updates are created on [Pythnet](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/how-pyth-works/pythnet)
and streamed offchain via the Wormhole Network, a cross-chain messaging protocol.
These updates are signed such that the Pyth onchain program can verify their
authenticity. Updating the onchain price is a permissionless operation: anyone
can submit a valid Wormhole message to the Pyth contract to update the price.
Typically, users of Pyth Network prices will submit a single transaction that
simultaneously updates the price and uses it in a downstream application.

Onchain prices can only move forward in time. If a user submits a Wormhole
message with an outdated price, the Pyth program will not fail, but will also
not update the price. This means there's no guarantee that when a user
atomically updates the price and then interacts with an application powered by
Pyth, the price that the application will read will be equal to the price the
user submitted.

## Use price feeds

### Price feed IDs

Each Pyth Network price feed has a unique ID. However, the IDs may be
represented in different formats (e.g., hex or base58) depending on the
blockchain. Price feeds also have different IDs in mainnets than testnets or
devnets. The full list of price feeds is listed on the [pyth.network website](https://pyth.network/price-feeds). The [price feed IDs page](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) lists the
ID of each available price feed on every chain where they are available. To use
a price feed onchain, look up its ID using these pages, then store the feed ID
in your program to use for price feed queries.

## Pyth on EVM (Linea)

Onchain EVM programs can use the [Solidity SDK](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-sdk-solidity) 
to read Pyth prices. The [EVM API reference](https://docs.pyth.network/evm) lets 
you interactively explore the complete API of the Pyth contract.

The offchain portion of the application can use [pyth-evm-js](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js) to generate price update transactions. This 
repository's [quickstart](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js#quickstart) includes an example of both the on- and offchain code necessary 
to integrate with Pyth.

### Networks

Pyth is currently available on the following Linea networks:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Network</th>
      <th>Contract address</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Linea Mainnet</td>
      <td><a href="https://explorer.linea.build/address/0xA2aa501b19aff244D90cc15a4Cf739D2725B5729">0xA2aa501b19aff244D90cc15a4Cf739D2725B5729</a></td>
    </tr>

### Price feed IDs

The price feed IDs for EVM chains differs depending on whether they are a
mainnet or testnet (see above):
