If you're new to public blockchain networks, you might not be familiar with _block explorers_. It's helpful to remember that the network is keeping track of a _ledger_ of accounts, with tokens attributed to them, sent between them, created by them, etc.

As users take actions on the network, there are changes to those accounts and tokens. A block explorer is an interface through which you can look at that information in all its raw, gritty detail.
