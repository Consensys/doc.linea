Building apps on Linea needn't be complicated. Linea is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-equivalent,
providing a development experience identical to Ethereum, and allowing you to leverage the many 
smart contracts, tools, and libraries created for EVM chains. 

In this guide, we'll walk you through using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to create a new 
project from scratch. 

This involves:
1. [Creating a project](#create-your-project)
2. [Deploying](#deploy-your-contract) and then [verifying](#verify-your-contract) your contract.

> _Estimated time to complete: ~20 minutes._

:::note Hardhat

If you'd prefer to deploy your contract using Hardhat rather than Foundry, see our [guide](../../how-to/deploy-smart-contract/hardhat.mdx).

## Prerequisites

A Linea-compatible wallet with some Linea Sepolia ETH. We recommend using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

[Get some Linea Sepolia ETH](../../how-to/get-testnet-eth.mdx).

## Create your project

To get started, we're going to use Foundry's `forge init` command to create a new project. [`forge`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/)
is the Foundry CLI tool.

Firstly, let's [install Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation):

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then initiate the new project, choosing whatever name you prefer. Make sure you're in the 
directory you want to create your project in:

```bash
forge init linea_test_project
```

Foundry will build out the file structure and create a git repository. It also installs one 
dependency: `forge-std`, the Forge Standard Library, which enables you to test your project.
To get more familiar with your new project, it might help to open it in a code editor and inspect
the files.

You can also run `forge build` to compile your project, and then `forge test` to use the `forge-std`
testing library.

:::note

If you already have a project set up, clone the project and run `forge install` in the directory to
use Foundry.

## Deploy your contract

The default Foundry template comes with a simple placeholder contract, `Counter.sol`. You're likely 
going to need something with a bit more functionality. You probably already have an idea of what 
you want your app to do, and you might have the skills to write your own contract from scratch. 

For simplicity, we're going to stick with `Counter.sol`, but you can use any template you want, or 
refer to our [contract templates section](../../tooling/contracts-templates/index.mdx) for more inspiration. 

We'll use the `forge create` command to deploy the contract. First, we must get an RPC endpoint and
ensure we have a secure method for using a private key.

### RPC endpoints

#### Get your RPC endpoint

To deploy a contract, you need to interact with the blockchain, which means you need an [RPC  endpoint](../../tooling/node-providers/index.mdx) 
to send those calls to. 

To keep things simple, we're going to use the default public RPC endpoint for Linea Sepolia: 
`https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build`.

Public endpoints such as this one are rate limited, and if you intend to deploy your app for public
use, you'll need an endpoint better equipped to handle the load. We recommend heading to the 
MetaMask Developer Dashboard to get a private RPC endpoint ([instructions](https://docs.metamask.io/developer-tools/dashboard/get-started/create-api/)).

You can also find alternative public and private RPC endpoints on our [node providers page](../../tooling/node-providers/index.mdx).

#### Update `foundry.toml`

Add the RPC endpoint to the `foundry.toml` file:

```toml
[profile.rpc-endpoints]
sepolia = "https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build"
```

### Store your private key

Deploying a contract requires an account's private key, which means you need to either provide it in
the command line when running the deployment command (not recommended) or store it securely and 
access it with alternative methods. See the [MetaMask support guide to finding your private key](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/).

:::tip[Private key security best practices]

We recommend [creating a new account in MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-add-accounts-in-your-wallet/)
specifically for this project, and [naming it](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-do-i-change-my-account-name-/)
something appropriate, such as "linea-project".

Even though we're working on a testnet, it's best to behave as if real assets were at stake, and
work in a sandboxed context with a somewhat expendable account.

:::

A standard approach is to store your private key as an environment variable in a `.env` file that 
is only stored locally (i.e. listed in `.gitignore` file). However, we're going to use Foundry's
keystore system to encrypt and store the private key, and then access it with a password. This 
ensures that you won't accidentally expose your private key—for example, in a GitHub repository.

To do this, we'll use Foundry's [`cast`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) CLI tool; specifically,
the [`cast wallet import`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-wallet-import) command.

```bash
cast wallet import --interactive test-account
```

The `--interactive` flag means that you'll be prompted to enter your private key in the terminal,
followed by a corresponding password. `test-account` is the name you want to give the account in 
the keystore; choose whatever is suitable for your purposes here.

When you enter the private key and then your password, you'll get confirmation that it has been 
stored successfully:

```
`test-account` keystore was saved successfully. Address: <YOUR_PUBLIC_ADDRESS>
```

Run `cast wallet list` to see accounts in your keystore.

### Deploy

#### Adjust Solidity version

By default, the `forge init` command we used originally creates the `Counter.sol` contract with the 
following Solidity compiler version:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
```

This enables the compiler to use any version newer than Solidity v0.8.13. [Linea is only compatible 
with Solidity 0.8.19 or lower](../../build/ethereum-differences.mdx), so we need to make some 
adjustments.

Add this line to `[profile.default]` in your `foundry.toml` file:

```toml
solc-version = 0.8.19
```

So that your `[profile.default]`, which is applied universally, now looks like this:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
solc-version = "0.8.19"
```

#### Run `forge create`

With your RPC endpoint to hand and your private key stored more securely, you're ready to deploy 
using `forge create`.

Execute this command, then enter your password to use the private key when prompted:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build --account test-account --broadcast src/Counter.sol:Counter
```

- `--rpc-url` is the RPC endpoint you want to use.
- `--account` is the keystore account you want to use to deploy the contract.
- `--broadcast` tells Forge to send the transaction to the network. You can test the command by 
omitting this flag, but you won't actually deploy the contract.

The format of the contract you want to deploy is `path/to/contract.sol:ContractName`; in this case,
we want the `Counter` contract from `src/Counter.sol`. 

If successful, you'll see this in the terminal:

```
Deployer: 0x ... // The address of the account used to deploy the contract
Deployed to: 0x ... // The address of the deployed contract
Transaction hash: 0x ... // The deployment transaction itself
```

You can copy each of these addresses and head to the [block explorer](https://sepolia.lineascan.build/) 
to see the deployed contract.

Make sure to copy the `Deployed to` address, as you'll need it to verify the contract. It'll also
be useful in part two of this quickstart, where we'll need it to interact with the contract in our
app.

## Verify your contract

Verifying a contract makes the source code publicly visible, and also confirms to others that it 
originated from a genuine source.

Verifying can be done with the `forge verify-contract` command, and requires a Lineascan API key.

### Get a Lineascan API key

Get a Lineascan API key by [creating an account](https://lineascan.build/myapikey).

Since it's best practice to avoid using API keys in the command line, add the API key to your 
`.env` file:

```
LINEASCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_LINEASCAN_API_KEY
```

Then modify the `foundry.toml` configuration file to include the Lineascan API key, pulling it from
the `.env` file:

```toml
[etherscan]
linea-sepolia = { key = "${LINEASCAN_API_KEY}" }
```

#### Run `forge verify-contract`

Execute this command: 

```bash
forge verify-contract --chain linea-sepolia YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS path_to_contract:contract_name --watch
```

`--watch` automatically runs the `forge verify-check` command to report verification status in the
terminal until verification is complete.

:::note

You can also complete verification at the same time as deployment by adding the `--verify` and
`--verifier-url` flags to the `forge create` command, and providing your Lineascan API key. 

For example:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build --account test-account --broadcast --verify --verifier-url https://api-sepolia.lineascan.build/api --etherscan-api-key LINEASCAN_API_KEY src/Counter.sol:Counter
```

:::

Now you've successfully deployed and verified your contract! It's recorded on the blockchain and
ready to receive calls from your app. 

## Next steps 

Proceed to [part two](./app.mdx) of this quickstart, where we'll build a simple web app for 
interacting with the counter contract.
