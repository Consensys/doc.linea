Publishing your app on the [Linea Hub](https://linea.build/hub) is the easiest way to reach users, grow your traffic, and get 
discovered in the Linea ecosystem. This is where the journey begins for production-ready apps.

A great listing boosts your visibility. A verified contract builds trust. And the more usage you get, 
the more we'll support and amplify your project.

Here's what your listing will look like on the Hub:

## Checklist: Create a great app page on the Linea Hub

Your app page is the gateway for your new users on Linea. Every section should help visitors understand what your app does, why it’s worth trying, and how it will add value to their onchain experience. If you have all the elements below for your app, you're on the right track:


### 1. Name
**Choose a simple, distinctive name that’s easy to read and remember.**

- It should hint at what your app does, while standing out among others.
  - **Protip:** Avoid using generic terms or names that are too close to existing apps!

### 2. Icon
**Your icon is your app's "visual handshake" with your users.**

- Keep it visually clean, on-brand, and easily recognizable even at small sizes (think favicon).
  - Avoid unnecessary details that clutter the design.

### 3. Tagline
**Think of your tagline as your app’s elevator pitch, in a single line.**
  
- Highlight a clear, tangible benefit, *not* vague superlatives.
  - Readers should **immediately grasp your app’s core value**.

### 4. Banner
**Your banner is the visual anchor of your app page.**

- Use a high-quality, uncluttered image that conveys your app’s feel and purpose.
- Avoid adding text; your app's name and tagline already appear above the banner.
- **Avoid light background colors**
- Keep important visual elements in **the top right section** to avoid cropping.
  
### App button
**Your app button should take users directly into the most engaging part of your app.**

- The Linea Hub is used across mobile and desktop, so **ensure your app is fully optimized for mobile use**.
- We automatically append UTM parameters to the button's URL, so you can track traffic coming from the Hub within your analytics stack. This helps to track conversions from the Hub, and provides insight to improve your app.

### 6. Screenshots
**Add up to three clear screenshots that capture the core features and user experience of your app.**

- Use these images to tell a visual story of what users can expect when they try your app.

### 7. Overview
**This is a compelling written introduction to your app.**

- The first sentence of your description is the most important: it’s what will make users decide to read more!
- Explain the problem your app solves, and why users will benefit from it.
- Follow this with a concise list of your key features
- Use a tone that aligns with your brand, and speaks in the language of your audience.

### 8. Ratings
**Users can leave ratings on your app; use that to your advantage.**

- From within your app, encourage your users to leave positive ratings on the Linea Hub. Higher ratings from others will improve your app’s discoverability across the Hub, and increase users' trust in your app.

### 9. Category
**Where would users look to find your app?**

- Select the most relevant category for your app to ensure it is discoverable to the right audience. 
- Consider multiple flows; users may be simply browsing, or filtering by interest.

### 10. Smart contracts
**Register your smart contract entry points on Lineascan.** 

- This helps improve your app’s discoverability across the Hub, and increase user safety
- We require all contracts to be verified on Lineascan.
  - If your are using a proxy pattern, include both proxy and implementation addresses; this allows us and power users to review the source code and identify issues eary. 
- Include **all deployed contracts users interact with, *directly or indirectly*.**

### 11. Final checks
**Are you camera-ready?**

- Make sure all URLs work (website, app, docs, socials, etc.)
- Link to your GitHub, if public
- Triple-check spelling, formatting, and clarity

## Checklist: Create a great event page on the Linea Hub

Your event page helps drive excitement and participation by showcasing engaging, time-limited experiences in your app. **Events are displayed directly on your app page, increasing visibility and conversion** by giving users a reason to engage with your app while the event is live.

If you include all the following elements for your event, you're setting yourself up for success:

### 1. Name
**Choose a clear, unique name under 30 characters that captures the essence of your event.**

- Use title case for consistency across events

### 2. Tagline
**Add a short tagline that communicates what makes your event unique and worth joining**.

### 3. Banner
**Use a high-quality image that is visually distinct from your app banner to avoid confusion and signal that this is a specific event**

- Avoid adding text: your event's name and tagline already appear above it.
- As with your app banner, **avoid light background colors**, and keep important visual elements in the top right section to avoid cropping.

### 4. Event button
**Ensure your event’s view button takes users directly into the event within your app**

- This minimizes friction and gets them to the experience quickly.
- Avoid directing users to another event page in your app that repeats the same thing.

### 5. Overview
**Craft a clear, engaging paragraph outlining what users will experience, followed by a short list of key activities, challenges, or rewards that will excite your audience.**

### 6. Availability
**Clearly specify your event’s start and end dates, and promote it up to 14 days in advance to maximize interest and visibility.**

### 7. Category
** Choose the appropriate event category to help users quickly understand the nature of your event**.

### 8. Performance tracking
**Use analytics in your Developer Hub to monitor impressions, views, and user engagement with your event.**

- Analyze these insights to refine and improve your future event strategies.

### 10. Promotion
**Promote your event on your social media channels and within your app.**

- Always link directly to your Linea Hub event page; this helps users trust the event:
  - It shows the event is **officially listed and verified within the Linea ecosystem**, which signals it’s real and safe.
