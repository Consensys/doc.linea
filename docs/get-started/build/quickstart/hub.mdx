Publishing your app on the [Linea Hub](https://linea.build/hub) is the easiest way to reach users, 
grow your traffic, and get discovered in the Linea ecosystem. This is where the journey begins for 
production-ready apps. 

The best way to do this is to create an account on the Linea Developer Hub. Click the button below
to get started:

<SubmissionButton />

The [Linea Developer Hub](https://developer.linea.build/) is a tool for managing your app, including:
- App details
- Token information
- [Events](./events.mdx).

You'll need to create an account at first, but once you're ready, the app will guide you through the
process of registering your app for the Linea Hub.

## Create a great app page on the Linea Hub

Your app page is the gateway for your new users on Linea. Every section should help visitors 
understand what your app does, why it's worth trying, and how it will add value to their onchain 
experience. A great listing boosts your visibility, and the more usage you get, the more we'll 
support and amplify your project.

If you have all the elements below, you're on the right track to an effective app listing:

### Name

Choose a simple, distinctive name that's easy to read and remember. It should hint at what your app 
does, while standing out among others. To differentiate your project, avoid using generic terms or 
names that are too close to those of existing apps.

### Icon

Your icon is your app's "visual handshake" with your users. Keep it visually clean, on-brand, and 
easily recognizable even at small sizes (think favicon). Avoid unnecessary details that clutter the 
design.

### Tagline

Think of your tagline as your app's elevator pitch in a single line. Highlight a clear, tangible 
benefit, _not_ vague superlatives. Readers should immediately grasp your app's core value.

### Banner

Your banner is the visual anchor of your app page.

- Use a high-quality, uncluttered image that conveys your app's feel and purpose.
- Avoid adding text; your app's name and tagline already appear above the banner.
- Avoid light background colors.
- **Keep important visual elements in the top right** section to avoid cropping. See the image below
  for reference. The MetaMask Card examples above demonstrate the relationship between the banner 
  image and the focus area within it.
- Ensure your banner meets the following requirements:
  - SVG or PNG 
  - 16:9 aspect ratio 
  - 1920x1080 resolution

<br />
  <div className="center-container">
    <div className="img-large">
      <img src="/img/get_started/build/quickstart/hub/image_specifications.png" 
      alt="Banner focus area" 
      />
    </div>
  </div>
  
### App button

Your app button should take users directly into the most engaging part of your app. The Linea Hub 
is used across mobile and desktop, so **ensure your app is fully optimized for mobile use**.

We automatically append UTM parameters to the button's URL, so you can track traffic coming from 
the Hub within your analytics stack. This helps to track conversions from the Hub, and provides 
insight to improve your app.

### Screenshots

Add up to three clear screenshots that capture the core features and user experience of your app. 
Use these images to tell a visual story of what users can expect when they try your app.

### Overview

This is a compelling written introduction to your app. The first sentence is the most important: 
it's what will make users decide to read more!

Explain the problem your app solves, and why users will benefit from it, and list your key features.
Use a tone that aligns with your brand, and speaks in the language of your audience.

### Ratings

Users can leave ratings on your app; use that to your advantage. From within your app, encourage 
your users to leave positive ratings on the Linea Hub. Higher ratings from others will improve your 
app's discoverability across the Hub, and increase users' trust in your app.

### Category

Where would users look to find your app?

Select the most relevant category for your app to ensure it is discoverable to the right audience. 
Consider multiple flows; users may be simply browsing, or filtering by interest.

### Smart contracts

Register your smart contract entry points on Lineascan. 

This helps improve your app's discoverability across the Hub, and increase user safety. We require 
all contracts to be verified on Lineascan. If you're using a proxy pattern, include both proxy and 
implementation addresses; this allows us and power users to review the source code and identify 
issues eary. 

Include all deployed contracts users interact with, *directly or indirectly*.

### Final checks

Are you camera-ready?

- Make sure all URLs work (website, app, docs, socials, etc.)
- Link to your GitHub, if public
- Triple-check spelling, formatting, and clarity
