Publishing your dapp on the Linea Hub is the easiest way to reach users, grow your traffic, and get 
discovered in the Linea ecosystem. This is where the journey begins for production-ready apps. 

A great listing boosts your visibility. A verified contract builds trust. And the more usage you get, 
the more we'll support and amplify your project.

Here's what your listing will look like on the Hub:

<div className="img-large" style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
   <Banner alt="Example banner" />
</div>

## What you'll need

- A deployed app live on Linea Mainnet
- A clear project name and short description
- A logo and banner image
- Verified smart contract
- Accurate URLs (website, app, socials, etc.)

Here's how the information you'll need matches up to the elements in your listing:

<div className="img-medium">
   <LabelledBanner alt="Labelled banner" />
</div>

## Submit 

Access the submission form to submit your dapp. 

## Optimization checklist

1. Project info
   - Pick a short, memorable name
   - Write a one-line tagline explaining what your app does
   - Add a short paragraph describing its benefits (think value prop, UX, rewards)
2. Visuals
   - Upload a clean, high-res logo (1:1 ratio)
   - Use a banner that represents your app (e.g. real UI screenshots)
3. Categories and tags
   - Choose the right category (e.g. DeFi, NFTs, Games, Tools, Social)
   - Add tags to help users understand more about your app
4. Smart contract verification
   - Submit the contract that users interact with (usually the proxy)
   - If using proxy pattern, include both proxy and implementation addresses
   - Make sure both the proxy and implementation contracts are verified on LineaScan
      - This builds user trust
      - Lets us audit your app before featuring it
      - Enables us to track usage so you can unlock visibility tiers
5. Final checks
   - Make sure all URLs work (website, app, docs, socials)
   - Link to your GitHub if public
   - Triple-check spelling, formatting, and clarity

## What happens next

1. We review your listing
