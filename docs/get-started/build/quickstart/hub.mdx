Publishing your app on the [Linea Hub](https://linea.build/hub) is the easiest way to reach users, grow your traffic, and get 
discovered in the Linea ecosystem. This is where the journey begins for production-ready apps. 

<SubmissionButton />

A great listing boosts your visibility. A verified contract builds trust. And the more usage you get, 
the more we'll support and amplify your project.

Here's what your listing will look like on the Hub:

<div className="img-large" style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
   <Banner alt="Example banner" />
</div>

## What you'll need

- A deployed app live on Linea Mainnet
- A clear project name and short description
- A logo and banner image
- Verified smart contract
- Accurate URLs (website, app, socials, etc.)

Here's how the information you'll need matches up to the elements in your listing:

<div className="img-medium">
   <LabelledBanner alt="Labelled banner" />
</div>


## Optimization checklist

### Create a Great App Page on Linea Hub

Your app page is your gateway to new users on Linea. Every section should help visitors understand what your app does, why it’s worth trying, and how it will add value to their onchain experience.

1. App Name
  - Choose a simple, distinctive name that’s easy to read and remember
  - It should hint at what your app does while standing out among others
  - Avoid using generic terms or names that are too close to existing apps
2. App Icon
  - Your icon is your app’s handshake with the user
  - Keep it visually clean, on-brand, and easily recognizable even at small sizes
  - Avoid unnecessary details that clutter the design
3. App Tagline
  - Think of your tagline as your app’s elevator pitch in a single line
  - Highlight a clear, tangible benefit instead of vague superlatives, helping users immediately grasp your app’s core value
4. App Banner
  - Your banner is the visual anchor of your app page
  - Use a high-quality, uncluttered image that conveys your app’s feel and purpose
  - Avoid adding text since your App Name and Tagline already appear above it
  - Avoid light background colors and keep important visual elements in the top right section to avoid cropping
5. App Button
  - Your App Button should take users directly into the most engaging part of your app
  - The Linea Hub is used across mobile and desktop, so ensure your app is fully optimized for mobile use
  - We automatically append UTM parameters to the Button URL so you can track traffic coming from the Hub within your analytics stack to understand conversion and improve your App page
6. App Screenshots
  - Add up to three clear screenshots that capture the core features and user experience of your app
  - Use these images to tell a visual story of what users can expect when they try your app
7. App Overview
  - Write a compelling introduction about your app
  - The first sentence of your description is the most important as it’s what will make users decide to read more
  - Explain the problem your App solves and why users will benefit from it. Follow this with a concise list of your key features
  - Use a tone that aligns with your brand and speaks in the language of your audience
8. App Ratings
  - From your App experience, encourage your users to leave positive ratings on the Linea Hub, as higher ratings from others will improve your app’s discoverability across the Hub and increase user's trust in your app
9. App Category
  - Select the most relevant category for your app to ensure it is discoverable to the right audience, whether users are browsing or filtering by interest
10. App Smart Contracts
  - Register your smart contract entry points. It helps improve your app’s discoverability across the Hub and increase user safety
  - We require all contracts to be verified on Lineascan. If using proxy pattern, include both proxy and implementation addresses. This allows us and power users to review the source code and identify issues early. Include all deployed contracts users interact with directly or indirectly.
11. Final checks
   - Make sure all URLs work (website, app, docs, socials)
   - Link to your GitHub if public
   - Triple-check spelling, formatting, and clarity

### Create a Great Event Page on Linea Hub

Your event page helps drive excitement and participation by showcasing engaging, time-limited experiences in your app.

1. Event Name
  - Choose a clear, unique name under 30 characters that captures the essence of your event
  - Use title case for consistency
2. Event Tagline
  - Add a short tagline that communicates what makes your event unique and worth joining
3. Event Banner
  - Use a high-quality image that is visually distinct from your app banner to avoid confusion and signal that this is a specific event
  - Avoid adding text since your Event Name and Event Tagline already appear above it
  - Avoid light background colors and keep important visual elements in the top right section to avoid cropping.
4. Event Button
  - Ensure your event’s view button takes users directly into the event within your app, minimizing friction and getting them to the experience quickly
  - Avoid directing users to another Event page in your App that repeat the same thing
5. Event Overview
  - Craft a clear, engaging paragraph outlining what users will experience, followed by a short list of key activities, challenges, or rewards that will excite your audience
6. Event Availability
  - Clearly specify your event’s start and end dates and promote it up to 14 days in advance to maximize interest and visibility
7. Event Category
  - Choose the appropriate event category to help users quickly understand the nature of your event
8. Event Display on App Page
  - Events are displayed directly on your app page, increasing visibility and conversion by giving users a reason to engage with your app while the event is live
9. Performance Tracking
  - Use analytics in your Developer Hub to monitor impressions, views, and user engagement with your event
  - Analyze these insights to refine and improve your future event strategy
10. Promotion
  - Promote your event on your social media channels and within your app
  - Always link directly to your Linea Hub Event Page to help users trust the event
  - It shows the event is officially listed and verified within the Linea ecosystem which signals it’s real and safe
