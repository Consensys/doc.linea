Now that you've deployed and verified your smart contract in [part one](./deploy.mdx), the next step 
is to create a frontend app that enables users to connect their wallet and interact with the 
smart contract.

In this guide, we will:
1. Set up a Next.js app 
2. Configure our app to connect to Linea Sepolia and your MetaMask wallet
3. Add buttons to the app to interact with your smart contract.

> _Estimated time to complete: ~25 minutes._

## Prerequisites

A wallet that can connect to Linea Sepolia. We recommend [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

Get some Linea Sepolia ETH by heading to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/linea) and asking 
in the `#testnet-faucet` channel.

## Set up a Next.js app using Dynamic

There are many frameworks out there for building web apps. We're going to focus on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
a React framework.

Conveniently, [Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz/) have created the `create-dynamic-app` which 
quickly creates a web3-enabled Next.js app which already has important packages like [Wagmi](../../tooling/libraries/wagmi.mdx) 
and [Viem](../../tooling/libraries/viem.mdx) (which Wagmi depends on) installed.

Run it like this:

```bash
npx create-dynamic-app@latest 
```

You'll also be prompted in the terminal to confirm a few project settings. Select Next.js as the 
framework, then make sure to enable Viem and Wagmi—libraries that we'll be using later.

Once you confirm the configuration, the `create-dynamic-app` package will install the necessary 
dependencies and your project will be ready to access in the new directory.

## Setup

The app needs a few adjustments before it will run.

Head to your `package.json` and adjust `react` and `react-dom` to `^18.0.0`. 
`create-dynamic-app` automatically installs `react` and `react-dom` `^19.0.0`, which are 
incompatible with the Dynamic SDK:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    // other dependencies
  }
```

And also adjust the `devDependencies: 

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18",
    // other dependencies
  }
```

Afterwards, run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

You can now run `npm run dev` to start the app locally. You can already connect your wallet, but 
you'll be unable to connect on Linea or Linea Sepolia until we configure our Dynamic dashboard, 
which we'll cover in the next step.

### Add a "Connect wallet" button

The first step to making the app usable is enabling visitors to connect their wallet. To do so,
we're going to use Dynamic's `DynamicWidget` component. Although we're just going to use the 
conventional "Connect wallet" usage—connecting an externally owned account (EOA)—the component has 
the advantage of allowing you to enable other sign-in methods and embedded wallet features with a few
minor changes on the Dynamic dashboard. This isn't something we're going cover here, but it's 
worth considering for your own app. 

To set up the widget, you'll need to sign up for a free [Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz/get-started) 
account, which enables you to access your own Dynamic dashboard. You can sign in with your wallet, 
so you don't have to worry about handing over personal information.

#### Get your environment ID

Now you've signed up and have access to your Dynamic dashboard, we can access an environment ID,
and then use the dashboard to configure the `DynamicWidget`.

On the dashboard, copy your `environmentId` from Developers > SDK & API Keys. 

Back in your project directory, head to `lib/providers` and find the `DynamicContextProvider` 
component. Insert your `environmentId` into the `settings`:

```tsx
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
      theme="auto"
      settings={{
        environmentId: "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID", // Add your environment ID here
           walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors],
      }}
    >
  )
```

#### Enable Linea wallet connectors

Connecting your local app to the dashboard means you can now configure the behaviour of the 
`DynamicWidget` component that is used in `app/page.tsx`.

On the dashboard, got to Chains & Networks in the sidebar. In the code snippet above, you can see 
that the `EthereumWalletConnectors` are already enabled; this means you should see the EVM button on
this dashboard page. Click it, then scroll and enable Linea and Linea Sepolia:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/build/quickstart/app/enable_linea_networks.png"
      alt="Toggles for the Linea and Linea Sepolia networks"
    />
  </div>
</div>

If you now run `npm run dev`, you'll be able to connect your wallet on Linea and Linea Sepolia. 
We now have the barebones of a web3 app: a frontend web app to which you can connect your wallet.

## Interact with your contract

Given the functionality of the contract we deployed in [part one](./deploy.mdx), we'll need a 
button to interact with the contract, prompting a transaction that will call our smart contract's 
`increment()` function and increment the counter. It'll also be helpful to display the current 
counter value in the app. 

To implement these features, we'll be using Wagmi hooks:
- [`useReadContract`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useReadContract) to read the current counter 
value, and;
- [`useWriteContract`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract) to call the smart 
contract's `increment()` function, and increase the counter.

### Display the counter value 

To display the counter value, we'll use the Wagmi `useReadContract` hook to retrieve the value
from the contract and display it in the app.

#### Configure Wagmi

To enable Wagmi to interact with Linea Sepolia, head to `lib/wagmi.ts` to find the Wagmi 
configuration file. Here, we need to replace `mainnet` with `lineaSepolia` and `linea` in a few 
places:
1. The import statement
2. The `chains` settings
3. The `transports` settings

Your Wagmi configuration should look like this:

```ts
// lib/wagmi.ts
import { http, createConfig } from "wagmi";
import { lineaSepolia, linea } from "wagmi/chains"; // Add this

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [lineaSepolia, linea], // Add this
  multiInjectedProviderDiscovery: false,
  ssr: true,
  transports: {
    [lineaSepolia.id]: http(), // Add this
    [linea.id]: http(), // and this
  },
});

declare module "wagmi" {
  interface Register {
    config: typeof config;
  }
}
```

With these changes, Wagmi hooks will now be able to interact with Linea Sepolia.

#### Get the ABI

Next, we'll need the smart contract's application binary interface (ABI)—a kind of standardized data 
structure that defines the inputs and outputs necessary for other programs to interact with the smart 
contract. This is a necessary step to ensure the Wagmi hooks work.

You can find it by pasting the smart contract address into the [Linea Sepolia block explorer](https://sepolia.lineascan.build/).
Find the "Contract" tab and scroll down to "Contract ABI". Copy the code:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/build/quickstart/app/abi.png"
      alt="The ABI of the smart contract"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Head back to your project repo and paste the code into a new file in your `lib` directory called 
`abi.ts`, adjusting the formatting:

```tsx
// lib/abi.ts
export const abi = [
    {
        "inputs":[],
        "name":"increment",
        "outputs":[],
        "stateMutability":"nonpayable",
        "type":"function"
    },
    {
        "inputs":[],
        "name":"number",
        "outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],
        "stateMutability":"view",
        "type":"function"
    },
    {
        "inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"newNumber","type":"uint256"}],
        "name":"setNumber",
        "outputs":[],
        "stateMutability":"nonpayable",
        "type":"function"
    }
]
```

#### Create counter component

Fetching the counter value from the smart contract and displaying it in the app requires more code 
than we could neatly place in `page.tsx`. Instead, we'll create a React component in 
`app/components` and import it into `page.tsx`.

Head to `app/components` in your project and create a new file, `Counter.js`, and add the below
code:

```js
// app/components/Counter.js
import { useReadContract } from "wagmi";
import { abi } from "@/lib/abi";

export default function Counter() {
  const { 
    data: counterValue, 
    error,
    isPending,
    refetch 
  } = useReadContract({
    address: "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS", // Add your deployed smart contract address here
    abi: abi,
    functionName: "number",
  });

  const statusText = isPending 
    ? "Loading..." 
    : error 
      ? "Error: " + error.shortMessage 
      : `Counter: ${counterValue?.toString() ?? "?"}`;

  return (
    <button 
      className="docs-button" 
      onClick={() => refetch()}
    >
      {statusText} • Click to refresh
    </button>
  );
}
```

:::note

Make sure to insert the address of your deployed smart contract.

:::

The component imports the `useReadContract` hook and the ABI you added previously. It then calls our
contract's `number()` function using `useReadContract` and displays the result in a button in the
app. We've also added some logic that displays "Loading..." while the data is being fetched, an 
error handling message that displays errors that are built into `useReadContract`, and the ability
to click the button to refresh the data.

#### Add counter component your app

Go back to your `page.tsx` and, alongside the existing import statements, add a statement to import 
the component you just created:

```tsx
import Counter from './components/Counter.js';
```

Now we can insert the component into the page:

```tsx
<div className="modal">
  <DynamicWidget />
  <Counter />
</div>
```

:::note

The Dynamic template app comes with a `<DynamicMethods />` component. We've removed it so we can
focus on the counter functionality, but you can leave it if you prefer.

:::

You can test the component works by heading to Lineascan and calling the `increment()` function on 
the Contract > Write Contract page. Click the "Connect to Web3" button to connect your wallet, and
then "Write" to prompt a transaction from your wallet that will increment the counter. If you head
back to your app and retrieve new data, you'll see that the counter has been incremented by 1.

Here's how it looks:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/build/quickstart/app/counter.png"
      alt="The counter component"
    />
  </div>
</div>

### Add a button to increment the counter

Our method for calling the `increment()` function in our smart contract is to use the Wagmi hook 
`useWriteContract`. Instead of reading data this time, we're asking the smart contract to do some
computation—incrementing the counter—which means we need to send a transaction with gas to pay for
the computation.

Since we've already configured `wagmi.ts` file and created `abi.ts`, we can move straight to adding
the component.

### Create increment component

Head to `app/components` and add a new file called `Increment.js`. Paste in this code, making sure
to replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the address of your deployed smart contract:

```js
import { useWriteContract } from "wagmi";
import { abi } from "@/lib/abi";

export default function Increment() {
  const { writeContract, isPending } = useWriteContract();

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    writeContract({
      address: "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS", // Add your deployed smart contract address here
      abi: abi,
      functionName: "increment",
    });
  };

  return (
    <button 
      className="docs-button" 
      onClick={handleIncrement}
      disabled={isPending}
    >
      {isPending ? "Incrementing..." : "Increment Counter"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Add the increment component to your app

Go back to your `page.tsx` and, alongside the existing import statements, add a statement to import 
the component you just created:

```tsx
import Increment from './components/Increment.js';
```

Now we can insert the component into the page:  

```tsx
<div className="modal">
  <DynamicWidget />
  <Counter />
  <Increment />
</div>
```

## Test your app

Now that everything is in place, we can test the app. 

Run `npm run dev` to run your app locally. 

The counter button should display the counter value already, and you can click to fetch the latest 
value at any time without sending a transaction. With your wallet connected and some Linea Sepolia
ETH, you should be able to click the "Increment Counter" button to add +1 to the counter value:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/build/quickstart/app/increment_button.png"
      alt="The increment button"
    />
  </div>
</div>

There you have it! A functioning web3-enabled app that interacts with a smart contract. 

## Deploy your app

Now that you have a working app, you can deploy it to make it publicly accessible. As we've been 
using Next.js, a framework developed by Vercel, we can easily use Vercel to deploy our app for free.

Since we're working on Linea Sepolia, we don't have the usual security concerns we'd need for a 
production app, so we can go straight ahead. 

### Add your repository to GitHub

The `create-dynamic-app` package we used at the start of this guide automatically created a git
repository for your project. This means your changes have been tracked. 

Firstly, run `npm run build` to build the app. This should surface any errors in your code that 
may prevent it from being deployed. If you need help resolving any, head to the #developer-chat
channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/linea).

When you're ready, make sure you've staged your changes with `git add .` and then committed them:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Now you're ready to publish your repository to GitHub. The easiest method is to [download and use
GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/adding-a-repository-from-your-local-computer-to-github-desktop),
though if you're comfortable with git, you might prefer [using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#importing-a-git-repository-with-the-command-line).

You can set your repository to public or private depending on your preference. You'll be able to 
deploy it either way.

### Deploy using Vercel

Now that your repository is on GitHub, you can deploy it using Vercel. [See the Vercel guide for
instructions](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/deploying-nextjs-app/deploy).

You'll need to create a Vercel account and link it to your GitHub account. Once you've done that,
you can deploy, and manage your app from Vercel.

## Next steps

Now that you have a grasp of the basics, you can start to experiment and build innovative apps that 
solve real-world problems and attract users. Here are some ideas for taking your app to the next 
level:

- Build in [account abstraction](../../tooling/account-abstraction/index.mdx) features to make your
app more accessible and user-friendly. The Dynamic widget that we used in this guide already 
enables you to use some of these features, configurable via the Dynamic dashboard.
- Accelerate development by using audited, reliable [contract templates](../../tooling/contracts-templates/index.mdx).
- Leverage an [oracle](../../tooling/oracles/index.mdx) to fetch data, such as token prices, and
display it in your app.
