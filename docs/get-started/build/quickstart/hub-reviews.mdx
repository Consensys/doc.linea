We review every **app, token, and event** submitted to the Linea Hub to ensure they are safe, high 
quality, and ready to deliver value to users while protecting the ecosystem.

## Why we review

Reviews protect users and ensure that apps, tokens, and events on the Hub meet security, usability, 
and quality standards. This helps users trust the projects they discover on the Hub, which ultimately 
brings more users to your app.

## What we check

- That all smart contracts your users interact with are publicly verified on Lineascan and meet 
  security and technical standards
- The app functions as described, without crashes or critical bugs
- Design meets quality standards
- Screenshots and descriptions accurately reflect the app experience
{/* - Privacy policies exist and are publicly shared with users (No needed for now) */}

## How long it takes

Most reviews are completed within 48 hours if submissions are complete. You will receive updates by 
email.

## What you need to submit

- A **tested, working app or event** without placeholder content and/or a token **deployed on Linea 
  Mainnet**
- Verification, on Lineascan, of **all smart contract addresses your users will interact with 
  through your app or token**
- **Accurate** descriptions and visuals
- Link to demo environment with credentials allowing for full app functionality testing
- **The best way to contact you** to share feedback on your submission (don't forget your specific 
email address, handle and platform, etc.)
- A **publicly accessible link to your privacy policy** explaining data collection and use

## What happens if changes are needed

If we do not approve your submission, we will share feedback through your preferred contact methods 
so you can adjust and resubmit quickly.

## After approval

Once approved, your app, token, or event will go live on [the Hub](https://linea.build/hub), and you 
can track performance and user engagement in your [Developer Hub](https://developer.linea.build).
