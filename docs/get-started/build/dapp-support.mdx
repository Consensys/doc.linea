Whether you're here to learn, build, or experiment, you're welcome. 

Our developer docs and active Discord are open to all, and we're excited to support your journey. 
That said, Linea operates on a performance-based model. We don't currently offer grants or stipends 
if your app isn't live or generating onchain activity. We won't provide financial support at this 
stage but we'll still cheer you on and help however we can through community resources.

Once your app is audited, live on Linea, and driving real usage, you'll unlock a range of 
opportunities designed to accelerate your growth:

- Promotion on the Linea Hub
- Featured placement on the Hub homepage as a new app
- Shoutouts on X and newsletter highlights
- Promotion of your live campaigns and reward programs on the Linea Hub
- For the most successful apps, potential financial rewards (including Linea co-funding your user 
incentive programs, introductions to top VCs and ecosystem partners, etc.)

We're here to champion builders who ship and scale. If you're creating value, we'll do everything 
we can to help amplify it and make you succeed.
