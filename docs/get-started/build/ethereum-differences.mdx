This page outlines Ethereum Mainnet functionality that differs on Linea, or is not yet available on 
Linea. Absence from this page indicates that the functionality is available on Linea and identical to 
behavior on Ethereum Mainnet; if you're experiencing otherwise, please get in touch via Discord.

## EVM opcodes

:::info important 

Linea uses the London version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). All EVM opcodes are managed 
identically to Ethereum London unless presented in the following table.

Solidity 8.23 and later compiles newer versions of the EVM by default. Use the `solc --evm-version london` 
command to ensure compatibility with Linea.

## Beacon root

[EIP-4788](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788), included in Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, 
introduced a smart contract that enables the caller to `get` or `set` the hash tree root of a 
beacon chain block.

This functionality is available with Linea Beta v4. However, due to the difference in block time
when compared to Ethereum Mainnet, only the root of the previous block is available.

## Call data

Linea's sequencer limits the size of call data, so that transactions can fit into the corresponding 
blob. The current limit is 60000 bytes.

## JSON-RPC API

Linea uses the standard Ethereum JSON RPC API methods. However, in a few cases, methods differ from 
those on Ethereum. These methods are documented in the [reference section](../../api/reference/index.mdx), 
and include:

- `linea_estimateGas`
- `linea_getProof`
- `linea_getTransactionExclusionStatusV1`
- `eth_sendRawTransaction`

Additionally, the following methods are not supported:

- `eth_newFilter`
- `eth_newBlockFilter`.
