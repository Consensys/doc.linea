This page outlines Ethereum Mainnet functionality that differs on Linea, or is not yet available on 
Linea. Absence from this page indicates that the functionality is available on Linea and identical to 
behavior on Ethereum Mainnet; if you're experiencing otherwise, please get in touch via Discord.

:::note 

With Linea [Beta v4](../../release-notes.mdx#beta-v4), Linea upgraded to the Pectra hard fork.

## EVM opcodes

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Opcode</th>
    <th>Ethereum</th>
    <th>Linea</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`BLOBBASEFEE`</td>
    <td>Returns the value of the blob base-fee of the current block.</td>
    <td>Will always return the minimum value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`BLOBHASH`</td>
    <td>
      Given an an input in the form of an `index`, indicating the position of a
      particular blob within an array of blobs associated with a transaction,
      returns the hash of the corresponding blob.
      <br /> <br /> If the index is out of bounds, returns `0`.
    </td>
    <td>Will always return `0`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`BLOCKHASH`</td>
    <td>
      Returns the hash of a requested block from the 256 most recent blocks.
    </td>
    <td>Returns the correct value, but the value is not guaranteed by the proof
      (Linea is a [type 2 zkEVM](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html), and
      uses/proves an L2-specific state representation).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`PREVRANDAO`</td>
    <td>Returns the RANDAO value from the previous block.</td>
    <td>
      Use a formula similar to Ethereum, e.g. `L2_prevrandao XOR hash(signed(slot_id))`.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

_Consult the Ethereum Foundation's [Opcode Reference](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodes/) 
for more._

[Evmdiff](https://evmdiff.com) is also a useful resource for comparing Linea with Ethereum, and 
[evm.codes](https://evm.codes/) is useful for information about specific opcodes on Ethereum.

## Precompiles

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Precompile</th>
    <th>Ethereum</th>
    <th>Linea</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`BLAKE2f`</td>
    <td>
      Compression function F used in the BLAKE2 cryptographic hashing algorithm.
    </td>
    <td>Not supported.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`MODEXP`</td>
    <td>Arbitrary-precision exponentiation under modulo.</td>
    <td>Only supports arguments (base, exponent, modulus) that do not exceed
      512-byte integers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Precompiles as transaction recipients</td>
    <td>Applicable to various use cases.</td>
    <td>Not supported. A transaction `to` address cannot be a precompile, i.e. an
      address in the range `0x01`-`0x09`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`RIPEMD-160`</td>
    <td>A hash function.</td>
    <td>Not supported.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Beacon root

[EIP-4788](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788), included in Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, 
introduced a smart contract that enables the caller to `get` or `set` the hash tree root of a 
beacon chain block.

This functionality is available with Linea Beta v4. However, due to the difference in block time
when compared to Ethereum Mainnet, only the root of the previous block is available.

## Call data

Linea's sequencer limits the size of call data, so that transactions can fit into the corresponding 
blob. The current limit is 60000 bytes.

## JSON-RPC API

Linea uses the standard Ethereum JSON RPC API methods. However, in a few cases, methods differ from 
those on Ethereum. These methods are documented in the [reference section](../../api/reference/index.mdx), 
and include:

- `linea_estimateGas`
- `linea_getProof`
- `linea_getTransactionExclusionStatusV1`
- `eth_sendRawTransaction`

## Type 3 transactions

Linea does not support type 3 (`0x3` or "blob") transactions. This type is used on Ethereum Mainnet 
primarily for layer 2 rollups to cheaply post data on L1.
