## EVM opcodes

:::info important
Linea uses the London version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). All EVM opcodes are managed
identically to Ethereum London unless presented in the following table.

Solidity 8.23 and later compiles newer versions of the EVM by default. Use the `solc --evm-version london`
command to ensure compatibility with Linea.

Check out [Ethereum's history](https://ethereum.org/en/history/) to learn about major milestones, 
forks, and updates to the blockchain.

> ⚠️ At the moment we do not support the `eth_newFilter` and `eth_newBlockFilter` RPC calls.

        changed due to the switch from PoW to PoS. `PREVRANDAO` returns a full 256-bit value that 
        represents the randomness beacon output of the previous block. For more, see the 'Security

[Evmdiff](https://www.evmdiff.com) is also a useful resource for comparing Linea with Ethereum, and
[evm.codes](https://www.evm.codes/) is useful for information about specific opcodes on Ethereum.

## Precompiles

### Precompiles as transaction recipients

On Linea, transactions cannot set the recipient of a transaction (the address in `to`) as a 
precompile. The `to` address of transactions cannot be in the range `0x01`-`0x09`.

### MODEXP

`MODEXP` (`0x05`) on Linea currently only supports arguments (base, exponent, modulus) that do not 
exceed 512-byte integers.

### Point evaluation

The point evaluation precompile was introduced in [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#point-evaluation-precompile). It is available on Linea as of the inclusion of the Pectra upgrades.

## JSON RPC API

Linea uses the standard Ethereum JSON RPC API methods. However, in a few cases, methods differ from 
those on Ethereum. These methods are documented in the [reference section](../../api/reference/index.mdx),
and include:
- `linea_estimateGas`
- `linea_getProof`
- `linea_getTransactionExclusionStatusV1`
- `eth_sendRawTransaction`
