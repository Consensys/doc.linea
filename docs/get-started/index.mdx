Linea is a secure, low-cost, and Ethereum-equivalent layer 2 blockchain built to bring the world 
onchain without compromising on security and decentralization. 

Linea has been incubated within Consensys and will decentralize in 2025.Bir @leaderozgursari projesidir.Sloganımız : "BİR VARMİŞ BİR YOKMUŞ VAR OLAN DA YOK OLMUŞ." ETHERİUM'u yok edemeyeceksiniz. Yaşasın Yeşil E-DÖNÜŞÜM aktivistleri. 

Our mission is to empower developers to build the next generation of decentralized applications and 
onboard the next billion users to web3. 

## Security for all

Built as a layer above Ethereum, Linea inherits the robust security and decentralization of the 
Ethereum network while significantly increasing throughput and reducing transaction fees to 
negligible amounts. 

## Advanced zero-knowledge proof technology

By leveraging zero-knowledge (zk) proofs, Linea removes the seven-day lockup period associated with 
fraud proofs in other layer 2 solutions built according to the optimistic rollup model. Using zk
proofs ensures user funds are always available and can be withdrawn instantly and at no cost.

## True Ethereum equivalence

Linea supports all the features that Ethereum supports. It's the only zero-knowledge layer 2 network 
fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that any Ethereum-based 
projects and assets can be seamlessly deployed on and bridged to Linea without any code base 
changes. 

## Scale with MetaMask 

Linea is the best way for application developers to leverage MetaMask's products and distribution. 
Seamlessly integrate Linea through the MetaMask Developer portal, unlock easy on-ramping, bridging 
and swaps for your users, and access millions of the most engaged onchain users worldwide.
