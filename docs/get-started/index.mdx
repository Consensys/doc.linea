Linea is a secure, low-cost, and Ethereum-equivalent layer 2 blockchain built to bring the world 
onchain without compromising on security and decentralization. 

Linea has been incubated within Consensys and will decentralize in 2025. 

Our mission is to empower developers to build the next generation of decentralized applications and 
onboard the next billion users to web3. 

## Security for all

Built as a layer above Ethereum, Linea inherits the robust security and decentralization of the 
Ethereum network while significantly increasing throughput and reducing transaction fees to 
negligible amounts. 

## Advanced zero-knowledge proof technology

By leveraging zero-knowledge (zk) proofs, Linea removes the seven-day lockup period associated with 
fraud proofs in other layer 2 solutions built according to the optimistic rollup model. Using zk
proofs ensures user funds are always available and can be withdrawn instantly and at no cost.

## True Ethereum equivalence

Linea supports all the features that Ethereum supports. It's the only zero-knowledge layer 2 network 
fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that any Ethereum-based 
projects and assets can be seamlessly deployed on and bridged to Linea without any code base 
changes. 

## Scale with MetaMask 

Linea is the best way for application developers to leverage MetaMask's products and distribution. 
Seamlessly integrate Linea through the MetaMask Developer portal, unlock easy on-ramping, bridging 
and swaps for your users, and access millions of the most engaged onchain users worldwide.
