description: How to run Linea's execution layer client, Maru. 
---

With Beta v4, Linea switched from a single to a dual-layer architecture, with both an execution layer
and consensus layer client. While node runners have a choice of several execution layer clients 
(documented in this section), Maru is the only consensus layer client available.

Developed specifically for Linea, Maru replaces the Clique Proof of Authority consensus algorithm 
and introduces the [Quorum Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://entethalliance.org/specs/qbft/v1/) (QBFT) consensus algorithm. Eventually, this change will mean Linea will be able to resemble Ethereum's
decentralized sequencer system, where validators propose and confirm blocks. To start with, however,
only one Linea-internal Maru node will produce blocks. 

:::warning

You must run Maru alongside an execution layer client like [Besu](./besu.mdx) or [Geth](./geth.mdx).
