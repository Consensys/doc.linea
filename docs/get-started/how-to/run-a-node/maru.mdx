description: How to run Linea's consensus layer client, Maru. 
---

With Beta v4, Linea switched from a single to a dual-layer architecture, with both an execution layer
and consensus layer client. While node runners have a choice of several execution layer clients 
(documented in this section), Maru is the only consensus layer client available.

Developed specifically for Linea, Maru replaces the Clique Proof of Authority consensus algorithm 
and introduces the [Quorum Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://entethalliance.org/specs/qbft/v1/) (QBFT) consensus algorithm. Eventually, this change will mean Linea will be able to resemble Ethereum's
decentralized sequencer system, where validators propose and confirm blocks. To start with, however,
only one Linea-internal Maru node will produce blocks. 

:::warning

You must run Maru alongside an execution layer client like [Besu](./besu.mdx) or [Geth](./geth.mdx).

## Run using the binary distribution

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html) 3.81

### Step 1. Clone the Maru repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Consensys/maru.git
```

### Step 2. Build the Maru binary

Run the following command to build a distribution:

```bash
./gradlew :app:installDist
```

### Step 3. Run Maru

Run the distribution with the following command:

```bash
./app/build/install/app/bin/app --maru-genesis-file=docker/initialization/genesis-maru.json --config=docker/maru/config.dev.toml
```

The distribution will be created in `app/build/install/app/` with all necessary dependencies included.

## Run using Docker

There are two methods you can use to run Maru using Docker:
- Clone the Linea monorepo and use `docker compose` 
- Clone the Maru repository and build a Docker image locally. 

<Tabs className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="Linea monorepo" label="Linea monorepo">

    ### Step 1. Clone monorepo

    The files you need to run Maru are available in the Linea monorepo at the [`/docs/getting-started` directory](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/tree/main/docs/getting-started), 
    in either the [linea-mainnet](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/tree/main/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet) 
    or [linea-sepolia](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/tree/main/docs/getting-started/linea-sepolia) 
    directories.

    Clone the monorepo with:
    
    ```bash
    git clone --depth 5 https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo.git
    ```

    ### Step 2. Run `docker compose`

    Navigate to one of the directories from step 1, and run:

    ```bash
    docker compose up maru-node
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Maru repository" label="Maru repository">

    ### Step 1. Clone Maru repository

    Clone the Maru repository with:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Consensys/maru.git
    ```

    ### Step 2. Run Maru
    
    Run Maru using the following command:

    ```bash
    make docker-run-stack
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
