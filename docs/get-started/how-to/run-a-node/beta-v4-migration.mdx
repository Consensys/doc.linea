Linea Beta v4 is a **mandatory hard fork** introducing **Maru**, the new consensus layer (CL).

Maru replaces Clique and aligns Linea with Ethereum's dual-layer design (execution and consensus).

After the fork:
- You must run **both** an execution layer (EL) client and Maru, a CL client
- Sequencer signatures move from EL `extraData` to the **Maru attestations API**.
- EL clients must be upgraded to Beta v4 compatible versions (any EL client that supports Prague
  should be compatible).

See the [Beta v4 release notes](../../../release-notes.mdx#beta-v4) for the scheduled hard fork dates.

## Breaking change: sequencer signatures

**Sequencer signatures will no longer be in EL block `extraData` after the upgrade.**

Before (pre-fork):

```
// on EL client
let signatures = block.extra_data;
```

After (post-fork):

```
// Must switch to Maru API
let signatures = maru_api.get("/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/{block_id}").data.message.body.attestations;
```

`attestations` returns a list containing the current block signature/attestation and the previous block
signature/attestation.


## Key architecture changes

### Current

- Single layer: EL client only (Besu with Clique)
- Sequencer signatures: Stored in EL block `extraData`
- Block production: Clique handles execution and consensus

### After Beta v4

- Dual-layer architecture: Execution Layer (EL) client + Consensus Layer (CL) client (The CL is
  currently powered by Maru, a consensus client implementing a customized variation of the QBFT
  algorithm. While Maru is the only supported client today, the architecture is designed to support
  future client diversity and algorithm evolution).
- Sequencer signatures: Moved to Maru's `SealedBeaconBlock.commitSeals`
- Block production: Maru (QBFT) coordinates consensus, EL executes transactions
- API: Signatures and consensus data available via Maru APIs

## EL client compatibility

By design, Linea with Maru will support any client compatible with L1. So any vanilla client compatible
with Prague will work.

Supported EL clients (from [e2e tests](https://github.com/Consensys/maru/tree/main/e2e)):

- Besu: [25.8.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/25.8.0) or higher
- Geth: Use the latest release (downtime required)
- Erigon: Use the latest release
- Nethermind: Use the latest release
- Linea-specific: A new `linea-besu-package` release will be provided separately

**⚠️ Geth-specific issue:**

- Geth v1.15+ → incompatible with Clique (pre-fork)
- Geth v1.13 → incompatible with Prague (post-fork)
- Result: No zero-downtime upgrade path; must plan maintenance window.

## Upgrade strategy

Depending on your EL client, follow the relevant upgrade path:

### Besu, Erigon, Nethermind (zero-downtime)

**Pre-upgrade**
- Prepare Docker setup (EL + Maru)
- Upgrade EL client to Prague-compatible version

**During upgrade**
- Start Maru before the fork timestamp
- Keep EL client running
- Monitor logs for sync and consensus:
  - `docker logs linea-maru | grep "imported block"`
  - `curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8545 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'`

**Post-upgrade**
- Verify block import in Maru logs
- Confirm EL block height with `eth_blockNumber`

### ⚠️ Geth (downtime required):

**Pre-upgrade**
- Prepare Docker setup (EL + Maru)
- Plan a short maintenance window after the fork
- **Note: the genesis file provided for Besu should be used for Geth as well.**

**During upgrade**
- Stop Geth after fork timestamp
- Upgrade to Geth v1.15+ (Prague-compatible)
- Start both Maru and Geth together

**Post-upgrade**
- Same verification steps as above

## Installation and setup guide

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose ([https://hub.docker.com/r/consensys/maru/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/consensys/maru/tags) or https://github.com/Consensys/maru)
- 8GB+ RAM (16GB recommended)
- Open ports: 8545, 8550, 8080, 9090, 9000
- Synced EL client (for example Besu Sepolia)
- L1 (Sepolia) RPC URL — required for Maru to track zk-proof verification and determine which L2
  blocks are finalized


### Step 1: Directory structure

```bash
mkdir -p ~/linea-node/{maru/config,besu/config}
cd ~/linea-node
```

### Step 2: Besu configuration (Sepolia)

Create `besu/config/config.toml`:

```toml
# Sepolia configuration
data-path="/opt/besu/data"
genesis-file="/opt/besu/genesis.json"

# Sepolia bootnodes
bootnodes=[
  "enode://6f20afbe4397e51b717a7c1ad3095e79aee48c835eebd9237a3e8a16951ade1fe0e66e981e30ea269849fcb6ba03d838da37f524fabd2a557474194a2e2604fa@18.221.100.27:31002",

        "00000000000000000000000000000000000000f9": {
          "balance": "0x1"
        },
        "00000000000000000000000000000000000000fa": {
          "balance": "0x1"

    }
```

### Step 3: Maru configuration (follower node)

Cleanup existing data in `/opt/maru/data` directory that will be used as `data-path` in Maru Configuration

Create `maru/config/maru-config.toml`:

```toml
# IMPORTANT: No [qbft] section = follower node (not validator)

# [linea]
# contract-address = "0xB218f8A4Bc926cF1cA7b3423c154a0D627Bdb7E5"
# l1-eth-api = { endpoint = "<your Sepolia RPC endpoint>" }
# l1-polling-interval = "6 seconds"
# l1-highest-block-tag = "finalized"

[persistence]
data-path = "/data"
private-key-path = "/data/private-key"

[p2p]
port = 9000  # Default port (can be same as discovery)
ip-address = "0.0.0.0"
static-peers = ["/ip4/3.129.120.128/tcp/31005/p2p/16Uiu2HAmR33t8RZiAHovuH9iH2UuUrajrbfyYowiYDAQo3D5Y9wg", "/ip4/3.129.120.128/tcp/31006/p2p/16Uiu2HAm9HB5oNmnmj8yY6T7dfhLVidVzYqa8QVDtEthkMr6b8tx"]
reconnect-delay = "500ms"

[p2p.discovery]
port = 9000
bootnodes = []
refresh-interval = "3s"

[payload-validator]
engine-api-endpoint = { endpoint = "http://linea-besu:8550" }  # Match Besu port!
eth-api-endpoint = { endpoint = "http://linea-besu:8545" }
payload-validation-enabled = false

[observability]
port = 9090
jvm-metrics-enabled = true
prometheus-metrics-enabled = true

[api]
port = 8080

[syncing]
peer-chain-height-polling-interval = "5s"
el-sync-status-refresh-interval = "5s"
sync-target-selection = "Highest"
desync-tolerance = 0

[syncing.download]
block-range-request-timeout = "10s"
blocks-batch-size = 10
blocks-parallelism = 10
max-retries = 5
backoff-delay = "1s"
use-unconditional-random-download-peer = false
```

### Step 4: Maru genesis file

Create `maru/config/maru-genesis.json`:

```json
    {
      "chainId": 59141,
      "config": {
        "0": {
          "type": "difficultyAwareQbft",
          "blockTimeSeconds": 2,
          "postTtdConfig": {
            "validatorSet": ["0x20e2654209c3f5a7b4728fb228778f1261f1013f"],
            "elFork": "Paris"
          },
          "terminalTotalDifficulty": 37331807
        },
        "1759147200": {
          "type": "qbft",
          "validatorSet": ["0x20e2654209c3f5a7b4728fb228778f1261f1013f"],
          "blockTimeSeconds": 2,
          "elFork": "Shanghai"
        },
        "1759233600": {
          "type": "qbft",
          "validatorSet": ["0x20e2654209c3f5a7b4728fb228778f1261f1013f"],
          "blockTimeSeconds": 2,
          "elFork": "Cancun"
        },
        "1760004000": {
          "type": "qbft",
          "validatorSet": ["0x20e2654209c3f5a7b4728fb228778f1261f1013f"],
          "blockTimeSeconds": 2,
          "elFork": "Prague"
        }
      }
    }
```
### Step 5: Create log4j.xml file

Create `maru/config/log4j.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="warn">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="[%-5level] %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %c{1} - %msg%n"/>
        </Console>
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <Root level="INFO" additivity="false">
            <appender-ref ref="console"/>
        </Root>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

### Step 6: Docker Compose setup

Create `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
networks:
  linea: {}

services:
  besu:
    image: hyperledger/besu:25.8.0
    container_name: linea-besu
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks: [linea]
    ports:
      - "8545:8545"        # JSON-RPC
      - "8550:8550"        # Engine API
      - "30303:30303"      # P2P TCP
      - "30303:30303/udp"  # P2P UDP
    environment:
      - JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx4g
    volumes:
      - ./besu/data:/opt/besu/data
      - ./besu/config/config.toml:/opt/besu/config.toml:ro
      - ./besu/genesis.json:/opt/besu/genesis.json:ro
    command:
      - --config-file=/opt/besu/config.toml

  maru:
    image: consensys/maru:54b73d9
    container_name: linea-maru
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - besu
    networks: [linea]
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"         # Beacon/REST API
      - "9000:9000/tcp"     # P2P main port
      - "9000:9000/udp"     # P2P discovery port (UDP only)
      - "9090:9090"         # Metrics optionnal
    environment:
      - JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx2g
    volumes:
      - ./maru/config:/opt/consensys/maru/configs:ro
      - ./maru/data:/data
    command:
      - "java"
      - "-Dlog4j2.configurationFile=/opt/consensys/maru/configs/log4j.xml"
      - "-jar"
      - "/opt/consensys/maru/maru.jar"
      - "--maru-genesis-file"
      - "/opt/consensys/maru/configs/maru-genesis.json"
      - "--config"
      - "/opt/consensys/maru/configs/maru-config.toml"
```

### Step 7: Launch and verify

```bash
# Start both services (Besu first then Maru)
docker-compose up -d

# Check Besu is syncing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'

# Check Maru health
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/eth/v1/node/health"

# Verify P2P connection
docker logs linea-maru | grep "Currently connected peers"
# Should show: peers=[16Uiu2HAmR33t8RZiAHovuH9iH2UuUrajrbfyYowiYDAQo3D5Y9wg]
```

## JWT Authentication

For production environments, you should enable JWT authentication:

### Generate JWT secret

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > ~/linea-node/jwt/jwt.hex
```

### Update Besu config

```toml
# Replace engine-jwt-disabled=true with:
engine-jwt-enabled=true
engine-jwt-file="/opt/besu/jwt.hex"
```

### Update Maru config

```toml
[payload-validator]
engine-api-endpoint = { endpoint = "http://linea-besu:8550", jwt-secret-path = "/jwt.hex" }
```

### Update Docker volumes

```yaml
# Add to both Besu and Maru:
volumes:
  - ./jwt/jwt.hex:/jwt.hex:ro
```

## Private key management

**Development**: Maru auto-generates private keys at startup if none exist. (TBC)

**Production**: Generate and backup your private key (not mandatory):

```bash
# Option 1: Let Maru auto-generate, then backup:
docker cp linea-maru:/data/private-key ./backup/

# Option 2: Generate using Maru's key generation tool:
# https://github.com/Consensys/maru/tree/main/jvm-libs/utils
```

:::info[Important]

Maintaining the same private key preserves node identity across restarts.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug commands

```bash
# EL client block height
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8545 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'

# Maru health
curl http://localhost:8080/eth/v1/node/health

# Check block headers
curl http://localhost:8080/eth/v1/beacon/headers/head
```
