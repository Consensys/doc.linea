description: Instructions for running Maru alongside an execution layer client

---

Linea Beta v4 is a **mandatory hard fork** introducing **Maru**, the new consensus layer (CL).

Maru replaces Clique and aligns Linea with Ethereum's dual-layer design (execution and consensus).

After the fork:

- You must run **both** an execution layer (EL) client of your choice and Maru, a CL client. A 
  standalone EL client will not work.
- Sequencer signatures move from EL `extraData` to the **Maru attestations API**.
- EL clients must be upgraded to Beta v4 compatible versions (any EL client that supports Prague 
  should be compatible).

See the [Beta v4 release notes](../../../release-notes.mdx#beta-v40) for the scheduled hard fork 
dates.

This page is intended for those who have already successfully upgraded their nodes to the Shanghai 
hard fork. 

## Overview of changes

### Breaking change: sequencer signatures

**Sequencer signatures will no longer be in EL block `extraData` after the upgrade.**

Before (pre-fork):

```
// on EL client
let signatures = block.extra_data;
```

After (post-fork):

```
// Must switch to Maru API
let signatures = maru_api.get("/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/{block_id}").data.message.body.attestations;
```

`attestations` returns a list containing the current block signature/attestation
and the previous block signature/attestation.

### Key architecture changes

#### Current

- Single layer: EL client only (Besu with Clique)
- Sequencer signatures: Stored in EL block `extraData`
- Block production: Clique handles execution and consensus

#### After Beta v4

- Dual-layer architecture: Execution Layer (EL) client + Consensus Layer (CL) client (The CL is 
  currently powered by Maru, a consensus client implementing a customized variation of the QBFT 
  algorithm. While Maru is the only supported client today, the architecture is designed to support 
  future client diversity and algorithm evolution).
- Sequencer signatures: Moved to Maru's `SealedBeaconBlock.commitSeals`
- Block production: Maru (QBFT) coordinates consensus, EL executes transactions
- API: Signatures and consensus data available via Maru APIs

### EL client compatibility

By design, Linea with Maru will support any client compatible with L1; vanilla client compatible 
with Prague will work.

Supported EL clients include:

- Besu: [25.8.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/25.8.0) or higher
- Geth: 
  - Pre-Shanghai: v1.13.15
  - Post-Shanghai: v1.16.x  
- Erigon: Latest release
- Nethermind: Latest release
- Linea-specific: A new `linea-besu-package` release is available via Docker: `consensys/linea-besu-package:beta-v4.0-rc17-20251024131506-d32162b`

## Upgrade to Cancun and Prague

After the Paris and Shanghai hard forks on October 22 and 23 respectively, the next step is to 
update your genesis files for both Maru and your EL client and then reinitialize your node.

:::warning Geth version

Ensure your Geth client is using v1.16.x or higher. Older versions will not be compatible after the
Cancun hard fork.

:::

### Step 1: New genesis files

First, find the files here:
- [Maru](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/blob/main/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/maru/maru-genesis.json)
- [Besu](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/blob/main/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/besu/besu-genesis.json)
- [Geth](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/blob/main/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/geth/geth-genesis.json)

### Step 2: Update `docker-compose.yml`

Retrieve the [updated `docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/tree/main/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet) 
file the Linea monorepo. 

Alternatively, update your existing `docker-compose.yml` file manually with the new `linea-besu-package` image (`rc17`):

```yaml
  besu-node:
      hostname: el-client
      container_name: linea-besu
      image: consensys/linea-besu-package:beta-v4.0-rc17-20251024131506-d32162b 
```

### Step 3: Reinitialize your node

First, stop your existing nodes:

```bash
docker compose down
```
Then reinitialize your node:

```bash
docker compose up maru-node besu-node
```

### Step 4: Verify 

After a successful reinitialization, you should see the following your logs:
