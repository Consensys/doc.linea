[Linea Beta v4](../../../release-notes.mdx), scheduled to be live on Mainnet in mid-September 2025, 
introduces breaking changes for existing nodes. 

If you're running a Linea node, you'll need to:
1. Upgrade your execution layer client to a version compatible with Beta v4, and;
2. Prepare to run the Maru consensus layer client alongside it.

**We'll share technical guides for both of these processes as soon as possible.**

## Node migration

Beta v4 implements the Pectra upgrade on Linea, and, simultaneously, the EIPs and protocol-level
changes that have occurred since Ethereum's London upgrade, to which Linea's VM is currently 
equivalent. (Not all of the EIPs implicated in these period are implemented in Beta v4; some will
arrive later.)

As these changes bring new opcodes, state formats, and transaction structures, among other features,
your node(s) _must_ be upgraded to continue functioning. 

## Maru

Maru is the new consensus layer client for Linea, replacing the existing consensus mechanism
centred around the [coordinator](../../../technology/coordinator.mdx).

With Beta v4, you must run Maru alongside your existing and upgraded execution layer client.
