[Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/) is an open-source Ethereum client developed under the
Apache 2.0 license and written in Java.

:::info important

Install and run a Besu node if you want to follow the Linea network by maintaining a local copy of 
the blockchain. However, if you want to interact with the network and use Linea-specific methods and 
features, you should [install Linea Besu](./linea-besu.mdx) instead.

:::

You can run Besu from a [binary distribution](#run-using-the-binary-distribution) or [using Docker](#run-using-docker).

Please note that you must run any execution layer client such as Besu alongside Linea's consensus
layer client, [Maru](./beta-v4-migration.mdx), for the node to function.

## Run using the binary distribution

### Step 1. Install Besu

[Download and install Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/install/binary-distribution) using
the instructions in the official documentation. 

### Step 2. Download the genesis file and Besu configuration file 

Download the genesis file and Besu configuration file.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Find the genesis file and configuration file [here](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/tree/main/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/besu).

  :::note[bootnodes]
  You can choose from a range of bootnodes for Linea Mainnet. The above configuration file uses 
  all bootnodes by default.

  The [bootnodes page](bootnodes.mdx) contains a full list of available bootnodes.

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Step 3. Define disk space volume (optional) \{#disk-space-besu}

Define a volume size appropriate to your expected usage. Besu nodes use: 

- Full node: <NodeSize network="mainnet" cluster="linea-prod-eks" pvc="data-linea-besu-full-0" />
- Archive node: <NodeSize network="mainnet" cluster="linea-prod-eks" pvc="data-linea-besu-archive-v3-0" />

<LastUpdated />

Use these figures as a basis to determine the extent to which you want to future-proof your node.

To limit disk space required, we recommend you configure Besu to use the [Bonsai](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/concepts/data-storage-formats#bonsai-tries)
data storage format, which prunes orphaned nodes and old branches.

Ensure you mount the Besu `data-path` to the custom volume when you start the node.

<VolumeCreation />

### Step 4. Configure the Besu configuration file

In your Besu configuration file, configure the following options:

- Set `data-path` to the location you want to store your data. 
- Set `genesis-file` to the path of your downloaded genesis file.

### Step 5. Start the Besu client

Run the Besu client with the location of your configuration file. For example:

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  ```bash
  besu --config-file=/Users/myuser/mainnet/linea-besu.config.toml
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linea Sepolia" label="Linea Sepolia">
  
  ```bash
  besu --config-file=/Users/myuser/sepolia/linea-besu.config.toml
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Besu node will attempt to find peers to begin synchronizing and to download the world state. 

## Run using Docker

:::warning Important

The Besu Docker image doesn't run on Windows.

:::

### Prerequisites

Download and install [Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and ensure it is 
running.

### Step 1. Download configuration files

Download the configuration files for the relevant network (in ZIP format) and extract them. The configuration
files include the network genesis file, Docker Compose file and Besu configuration file.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Head to the [`/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/tree/main/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet)
  directory in the Linea monorepo for all the files you need. Make sure you download the contents of
  both:
  - `/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet`, which contains the `docker-compose.yml` file that you'll 
    run, and;
  - `/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/besu`, which contains the genesis file and configuration 
    file.
  
  You can choose to manually download each, copy their contents into files of your own, or clone the 
  Linea monorepo.

  :::note[bootnodes]
  You can choose from a range of bootnodes for Linea Mainnet. The Besu `.zip` includes a
  config file named `config-snap-mainnet.toml` where bootnodes are specified. The file uses all bootnodes
  by default.

  The [bootnodes page](bootnodes.mdx) contains a full list of available bootnodes.
  :::
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linea Sepolia" label="Linea Sepolia">
  
  Head to the [`/docs/getting-started/linea-sepolia`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/tree/main/docs/getting-started/linea-sepolia/)
  directory in the Linea monorepo for all the files you need. Make sure you download the contents of
  both:
  - `/docs/getting-started/linea-sepolia`, which contains the `docker-compose.yml` file that you'll 
    run, and;
  - `/docs/getting-started/linea-sepolia/besu`, which contains the genesis file and configuration 
    file.
  
  You can choose to manually download each, copy their contents into files of your own, or clone the 
  Linea monorepo.
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Update the Docker Compose file

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, update the `--p2p-host` command to include your public IP address. For example:

```yaml
--p2p-host=103.10.10.10
```

:::tip

You can use [this page](https://whatismyip.com/) to find your public IP address.

:::

The file also contains `docker compose` commands for other execution layer clients; delete those if 
you want, or just disregard them. 

### Step 3. Start the Besu node

Open a terminal, in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file, run `docker-compose up besu-node`. 

It can take up to 20 minutes for the node to find peers. If it takes any longer than that, try restarting the node.

:::tip Troubleshoot peering issues

Refer to the [Besu troubleshooting information](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/how-to/troubleshoot/peering)
for help if you experience peering issues.   

:::

## Confirm the node is running

You can call the JSON-RPC API methods to confirm the node is running. For example, call
[`eth_syncing`](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/reference/api#eth_syncing) to return the synchronization status.
For example the starting, current, and highest block, or `false` if not synchronizing (or if the head of the chain has been reached).

```bash

curl localhost:8545 \
        -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}'

```

You should get a result similar to:

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "startingBlock": "0x0",
    "currentBlock": "0x5d228",
    "highestBlock": "0x3cedec"
  }
}
```
