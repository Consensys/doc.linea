# Run a Linea node

This section guides you through running a Linea node using various compatible Ethereum clients.

:::info important
While Linea supports multiple clients, only Linea Besu currently allows you to access Linea-specific
features, such as using [Linea methods](../../../api/reference/index.mdx) (for example, `linea_estimateGas`)
or calling methods using the `finalized` tag.

Linea Besu is recommended for infrastructure providers and operators who intend to run a Linea
node, whether for offering node services to others or for using Linea with a personal, private RPC endpoint.
:::

The vanilla Ethereum clients such as Besu, Geth, and Erigon are recommended if you only want to follow the
Linea chain. They allow you to have a local copy of the Linea blockchain. This view of the state is
"trusted" until the transaction, or the block that transaction is in, has been finalized on L1.

The following table lists the clients covered in this guide, and whether they provide direct access
to Linea-specific features.

There are no financial incentives for running a Linea node, and there is currently no option to
vote on blocks as part of the consensus mechanism or
[fork-choice](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/forkchoice/#whats-a-fork-choice) like on Ethereum.
