:::note

We recommend that only tech operators that are providing liquidity use Linea's native bridge to 
transfer ERC-20 tokens.

For everyday bridge transfers, we recommend you use the
[MetaMask Portfolio bridge](https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge), which aggregates bridging options
across Linea and shows you the best rates.

:::

ERC-20 tokens can only be bridged using manual claiming, which
requires you to cover the ETH fee on the destination layer. Ensure your wallet is properly funded
before beginning this process.

:::note
If you're bridging a token to Linea that hasn't been deployed before and you see a difference in the
transferred token amount, this could be a
["token bridge decimal mismatch"](#token-bridge-decimal-mismatch), which affects how
the value is displayed. The chance of encountering this is quite low, but still good to know about.
:::

The guide on [how to bridge ETH](./how-to-bridge-eth.mdx) shows how to use our bridge
and appropriately fund your wallet.

1. Go to the [Linea bridge](https://bridge.linea.build/).

2. Connect your wallet in the top-right corner of the page.

      alt="Linea bridge connect wallet button"
    />
  </div>
</div>

3. Enter the token selection menu by clicking on the current token symbol (ETH in this case).

      alt="Linea bridge select token"
    />
  </div>
</div>

4. Select one of the available tokens in the list. If the token is not in the list, use the search
bar to find it by contract address, symbol, or its full name. Click on your preferred token to 
select it.

      alt="Linea bridge select token list"
    />
  </div>
</div>

5. You now can bridge this token, and it will be saved in your token list for future bridging.

## Token bridge decimal mismatch

When an ERC-20 token is bridged from one chain to the other and the token has not been deployed on 
the destination chain, the Token Bridge Smart Contract will attempt to determine the “decimals” of 
the ERC-20 token. If the decimals cannot be determined by reading the origin ERC-20 token contract 
(e.g. a token contract doesn't adhere to the [ERC-20 standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)), 
it will default to 18 decimals.

This can result in the token quantities displaying incorrectly on the destination chain. For example, 
if a token has 16 decimals on L1 but doesn't specify the decimals in token contract, it will 
default to 18 decimals on Linea. Bridging 1 token from L1 will show up as 0.01 on L2. When you 
bridge back the 0.01 to L1, it'll become 1 token again.

Decimal mismatches are rare, since most tokens with specified decimals usually adhere to the ERC-20 
standards.
