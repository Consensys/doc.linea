You can bridge tokens (ETH or ERC-20) to provide liquidity in different ways. Linea's default 
canonical token bridge allows you to bridge ETH or ERC-20 tokens using a UI.

The default canonical token bridge is suited for protocols that need their tokens on L2 for
DeFi and other uses without any special requirement for custom features (Vanilla ERC20). For protocols
that require custom features or want to implement complex cross-chain logic, consider a custom
implementation or building a dedicated token bridge.

:::note
We recommend that tech operators that want to provide liquidity use the
[**Native Bridge for Tech Operators**](https://bridge.linea.build/) which provides the interface to
the [canonical token bridge](../../../technology/canonical-token-bridge.mdx).

Select one of the following cards for instructions to bridge using the default canonical token bridge.

## Custom options for moving large liquidity

### Use the canonical token bridge with a custom `BridgedToken` implementation

This is suited for protocols that want to implement special features for the bridged ERC20 on L2.
**This is only possible if the token has not yet been bridged from L1 to L2 in order to avoid
unexpected changes for end-users.**

Protocols that want to use a custom BridgedToken will be able to incorporate arbitrary logic on the L2
ERC20, while still relying on the Token Bridge lock and mint logic and cross-chain communication.
**For this to work, protocols need to keep compatibility with the Token Bridge by enabling it to call the ERC20 mint and burn functions.**

If you are interested in this option, please contact the Linea team to get started. The process is as follows:

- The token issuer deploys a custom BridgedToken which should enable the Token Bridge to call mint and burn functions.
- Linea team will configure the bridge so that it will use your custom contract to mint and burn tokens on L2.

:::note

If you are not yet ready with your own implementation, you can deploy the standard BridgedToken implementation behind a dedicated upgradable proxy that you will be able to upgrade later

:::

### Build a dedicated token bridge

This is intended for partners who need full control over the bridge and want to implement complex cross-chain logic.

The partner will be in charge of building, auditing and operating their own token bridge.

If you are interested by this option, please get in touch with us so that we can:

- Block your L1 token from being bridged on L1 in order to avoid having several copies on Linea
- Provide guidance if you want to rely on our cross-chain messaging system

## What are the execution fees?

Two types of execution fees can be applied when you are bridging your tokens: the postman fee and 
the anti-DDOS fee. Since the postman fee is only applied during the automatic claiming process, 
execution fees vary depending on _what_ you're bridging and the direction.

Refer to the table for which fees will apply to your bridge transfer:

Key:
- Transaction fee: The transaction (gas) fee required for the bridge operation.
- Anti-DDOS fee: A 0.001 ETH fee applied when bridging from L2 to L1.
- Postman fee: `target layer gas price * (gas estimated + gas limit surplus) * margin`, where:
  - `target layer gas price` = `eth_gasPrice` on the target layer
  - `gas estimated` = 100,000
  - `gas limit surplus` = 6000
  - `margin` = 2
