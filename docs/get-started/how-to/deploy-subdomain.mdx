---

This guide is for developers who want to manage subdomains on Linea for domains they own
on [L1 ENS](https://app.ens.domains/).

For example, if you own the domain `example.eth` on L1, you can create and manage subdomains like
`sub.example.eth` on Linea that resolves to the L1 domain, ensuring seamless integration and resolution
across both layers.

## Requirements 

- [L2 contracts](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/tree/main/packages/linea-ens-contracts): 
    These Linea contracts handle all operations on your subdomains, including registrations and setting records.
- [L1 contracts](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/tree/main/packages/linea-ens-resolver): 
    These contracts enable subdomains created on Linea to resolve on L1. You can reuse the
    existing Linea contracts, unless you require customizations.
- User interface (UI): The UI for managing subdomains; you can adapt the [Linea Names app](https://names.linea.build/)
    in the [Linea Names GitHub repository](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/tree/main/packages/linea-ens-app). 
    If you decide to deploy this UI, you will also need to deploy the
    [Linea Names Subgraph](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/tree/main/packages/linea-ens-subgraph), and
    include your own values into the [`env.ts`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/blob/main/packages/linea-ens-subgraph/src/env.ts)
    file.

    :::tip
    Follow the [quickstart guide](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/tree/main/packages/linea-ens-app#quick-start-on-localhost) 
    to test it locally. Replace the environment variables `BASE_DOMAIN`, `BASE_NODE`, `BASE_LABEL`, and
    `BASE_LABEL_HASH` in the `.env` files (`.env.example` and `env.ts`) with the values matching your ENS domain.
    :::

## Available deployment methods

Use one of the following deployment methods to deploy your subdomain.

### Use the same approach as `linea.eth`

Manage your subdomains the same way `linea.eth` subdomains are managed using the deployment [steps below](#steps).
This includes using the Proof of Humanity (PoH) check for registering subdomains.

### Deploy registrar contracts only 

Deploy only your `Registrar` contracts while using the same `Registry` and `Resolver` contract
addresses deployed for the `linea.eth` subdomain. Contact [Linea Support](https://support.linea.build/)
to gain ownership of an L1 domain on Linea. This solution allows you to deploy only the registrar contracts.

### Use ENS contracts 

Modify the [original ENS contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts).
You must modify the node managed by the Registrar contract to match your domain's node. 

For example, for `linea.eth`, we set the node in the [contract's constructor](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/blob/49c1bd707467daa3a77d06592e2523d74825bdfb/packages/linea-ens-contracts/contracts/ethregistrar/ETHRegistrarController.sol#L162). 

:::warning 

If you modify the `PublicResolver` contract and it impacts storage, you must deploy your own 
`L1Resolver` contract on L1 to match those modifications, as the `L1Resolver` uses hard-coded 
storage slots (as seen [here](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/blob/1b896c9f6f77c6258926957af370bb3d692f540a/packages/linea-ens-resolver/contracts/L1Resolver.sol#L36)).

## Steps

The following steps show how to deploy and configure subdomain contracts on Linea in the same way that 
they were used to create the `linea.eth` subdomain.

### 1. Deploy subdomain contracts

Deploy the subdomain contracts on the Linea network:

1. Clone the [Linea Names repository](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens) and execute the 
    following commands:

    ```bash
    cd ./packages/linea-ens-contracts
    yarn
    cp .env.org .env
    ```

1. Replace the following keys in the `.env` file with your own information:

    :::danger
    Do not commit the `.env` file to your repository if it contains sensitive data. You can
    create a `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing the file.
    :::

    ```
    DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=
    OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY=
    INFURA_API_KEY=
    BASE_DOMAIN=
    ```

   :::note
   Replace `BASE_DOMAIN` environment variable with the L1 ENS domain you own. For example, for `linea.eth`,
   it's `linea`.
   :::

1. Deploy the contract: 

    ```bash
    yarn hardhat deploy --network lineaMainnet
    ```

1. Copy the `PublicResolver` contract address from the `./deployments/lineaMainnet/PublicResolver.json` 
file:

    ```
    "address": "0x86c5AED9F27837074612288610fB98ccC1733126",
    ```

    Copy this address â€” you'll need it in the next step.

The contracts to manage your subdomains on Linea have now been deployed. The next step is to link 
these subdomains to your L1 domain on L1 for [CCIP resolution](../tooling/cross-chain/ccip-read.mdx) to work.

### 2. Set the Linea target resolution

Set the Linea target resolution on the L1 ENS domain:

1. Retrieve the DNS encoded name for your ENS domain by running:

    ```bash
    ts-node scripts/getENSHashes.ts yourdomain.eth
    ```

    For example, `ts-node scripts/getENSHashes.ts linea.eth`

    Example output:

    ```bash
    The namehash of 'linea.eth' is: 0x527aac89ac1d1de5dd84cff89ec92c69b028ce9ce3fa3d654882474ab4402ec3
    The DNS encoded name of 'linea.eth' is: 0x056c696e65610365746800
    ```

    Keep the DNS encoded name result, for example `0x056c696e65610365746800`.

1. Go to the [Linea Custom Resolver contract on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde16ee87B0C019499cEBDde29c9F7686560f679a#writeContract).

1. In the **Write Contract** tab, connect your wallet using the **Connect with web3** button.
    Make sure to connect with the wallet containing the account that owns your L1 ENS domain.
    In the `setTarget` function add the following parameters:
    - `name`: The DNS encoded name you got from step 1.
    - `target`: The Linea resolver target address you copied from the `PublicResolver.json` file
        in the previous step.

    Then select **Write** and approve the transaction.

1. Go to the [ENS app](https://app.ens.domains/).

1. Search for your ENS domain and go to the profile page.

1. Select the **More** tab, and in the **Resolver** section select **Edit**.

1. Select **Custom Resolver** and add the address `0xde16ee87B0C019499cEBDde29c9F7686560f679a`.

1. Select **Update** and approve the transaction.

The setup to manage subdomains on Linea for your ENS domain is now complete and configured 
similarly to `linea.eth`. This means anyone with an active PoH on Linea can now register a 
`subdomain.yourdomain.eth` that will be resolved on the L1 ENS.
