To get started with building on Linea you'll need some Linea Sepolia ETH. The most efficient method
is to use one of the many available faucets to drip testnet ETH directly to your chosen account.

## Linea Discord

Head to the [Linea Discord](https://discord.gg/linea) and request some Linea Sepolia ETH in the 
`#testnet-faucet` channel.

## MetaMask faucet

The [MetaMask faucet](https://docs.metamask.io/developer-tools/faucet/) supports using Linea Names 
domains, and using one guarantees you'll receive the full 0.5 ETH daily maximum. [Learn how to get a
