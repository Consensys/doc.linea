To get started with building on Linea you'll need some Linea Sepolia ETH. The most efficient method
is to use one of the many available faucets to drip testnet ETH directly to your chosen account.

## MetaMask faucet

The [MetaMask faucet](https://docs.metamask.io/developer-tools/faucet/) supports using Linea Names 
domains, and using one guarantees you'll receive the full 0.5 ETH daily maximum. [Learn how to get a

enables you to select from a handful of different testnet ERC-20 tokens.
