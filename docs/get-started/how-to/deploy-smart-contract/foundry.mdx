In this quickstart, we'll create a basic [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) project. Here's a video walkthrough:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you download and install Foundry:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    ```

Then, open a new terminal, and call `foundryup` to install the latest release.

## Create a Foundry project

To create a Foundry project, run:

```bash
forge init linea-tutorial
```

Running `forge init` sets up a sample contract, test, and script for `Counter.sol`.

Now change into the directory:

```bash
cd linea-tutorial
```

## Deploy a smart contract

To deploy a smart contract we highly recommend using an Infura endpoint, as the public endpoint may 
experience rate limiting and is not meant for production use.

[Sign up for an Infura account](https://docs.infura.io/api/getting-started) to get an API key that
provides access to the Linea endpoints. Assign the Linea endpoints you want to access to your API key.

:::caution

These instructions use API keys and private keys inline. We highly recommend hiding them
[in `.env` files](#deploy-a-smart-contract-using-a-env-file)

:::

Deploy your contract using the following syntax:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url YOUR_LINEA_ENDPOINT src/Counter.sol:Counter --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

In the command:

- Replace `YOUR_LINEA_ENDPOINT` with the URL of a
    [supported Infura Linea network](https://docs.metamask.io/services/get-started/endpoints/)
    or [public endpoint URL](../../build/network-info.mdx).
- Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your wallet's private key.

Your output should look similar to:

```bash
Deployer: YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER
Deployed to: 0xED0Ff7E8B655dFFfCA471ea3B6B649ce7C2C1b83
Transaction hash: 0x967e1290b285e67b3d74940ee19925416734c345f58bd1ec64dcea134647d7ee
```

## Deploy a smart contract using a `.env` file

Directly pasting your private key into the command line poses security risks. To avoid exposing 
sensitive information such as wallet private keys or API keys, use files with the `.env` extension 
to store private data. Create a `.env` file, then add the file to the `.gitignore` file to prevent 
committing it. Populate the `.env` file with the relevant private information:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
INFURA_API_KEY=YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY
```

Then, run:

```bash
source .env
```

Finally, modify the `foundry.toml` file to store the various RPC endpoints we might be working with. For example:

```bash
[profile.rpc-endpoints]
linea-sepolia = "https://linea-sepolia.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_API_KEY}"
linea-mainnet = "https://linea-mainnet.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_API_KEY}"
```

To deploy the smart contract, run:

<Tabs className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="Mainnet" label="Mainnet" default>

```bash
forge create --rpc-url linea-mainnet src/Counter.sol:Counter --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Sepolia" label="Sepolia">

```bash
forge create --rpc-url linea-sepolia src/Counter.sol:Counter --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, you can optionally [verify your contract on the network](../verify-smart-contract/foundry.mdx).
