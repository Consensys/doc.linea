Atlas is a browser-based IDE with an integrated AI assistant that allows you to write, test and deploy smart contracts directly from your browser.

## Deploy a contract

1. Go to `https://app.atlaszk.com`.
1. Go to the top right and change the network to the Linea mainnet or testnet.
1. Select **Deploy**.

You can write tests for your contract (Foundry is built-in), and ask the AI to help you write your
contracts, deployment scripts, and more.

View [the tutorial](https://youtube.com/embed/mnyYizj3l_8?si=eVXHsWWZxlg9EU4D), which shows how to build a
DEX from scratch on Linea. You can also [open and run the tutorial](https://app.atlaszk.com/projects?template=https://github.com/sameesiddiqui/LilDex&open=LilDex.sol) in one click.
