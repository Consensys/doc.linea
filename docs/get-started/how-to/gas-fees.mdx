# Estimate transaction costs

## How gas works on Linea

Linea supports the [Ethereum EIP-1559 gas price model](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/gas):
```
total fee = units of gas used * (base fee + priority fee)
```

Linea is EVM-equivalent, and gas therefore works extremely similarly to Ethereum. The main difference 
is that **the base fee effectively stabilizes at 7 wei.** Linea blocks use up to around 50% of the 
maximum block size of 2 billion gas, and the base fee decreases or increases by 12.5% per block 
according to network traffic, identically to Ethereum. However, when the base fee reaches 7 wei, 
12.5% is less than 1 wei, and the reduction is rounded down to zero; so the fee remains 7 wei. 
The base fee is also burned, like on Ethereum.

The gas cost to submit your transaction and include it on Ethereum involves the following fee 
components:

- **Layer 2 cost**: The execution fee; the cost of including your transaction on the Linea 
  sequencer, and calculated using a similar formula to Ethereum (as described above). 
- **Layer 1 cost**: The cost of publishing your L2 transaction on Ethereum, which varies 
  based on the blob fee market.

These two resource costs are abstracted by the rollup and covered by the recommended L2 gas price
and gas used.

and release notes for [Alpha v2](../../release-notes.mdx#alpha-v2) and [Alpha v3](../../release-notes.mdx#alpha-v30).

`linea_estimateGas` is the recommended method for estimating gas on Linea. See our 
[reference page](../../api/reference/linea-estimategas.mdx) for more information. 

Linea also supports:
- [`eth_estimateGas`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_estimategas)
- [`eth_gasPrice`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_gasprice)
- [`eth_feeHistory`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_feehistory).

## Gas pricing

The gas price returned by `linea_estimateGas` is based on the variable data cost of the previous 
block with a multiplier applied as a buffer to ensure inclusion.

Each Linea block's `extraData` field is populated with the following gas price values that are used 
by `linea_estimateGas` to calculate the cost of a transaction:
- A `FIXED_COST` of 0.03 Gwei, which reflects infrastructure costs;
- `ADJUSTED_VARIABLE_COST`, which is the cost per byte of data submitted to L1, and;
- `ETH_GAS_PRICE`, used to set a more accurate return value for any `eth_gasPrice` calls. 

:::note

The `extraData` field is a 32-byte space used to store arbitrary data, such as metadata or 
additional information relevant to the block. 

On Linea, it's used by the sequencer and Linea Besu nodes running the correct plugins to expose 
`linea_estimateGas`.

:::

Variable cost is calculated with the following formula:

```bash
ADJUSTED_VARIABLE_COST = max(base_variable_cost, previous_variable_cost * ( 1 + delta / CHANGE_DENOMINATOR )
```

Where:
- `base_variable_cost` is calculated with the below formula:
  ```python
  variable_cost (4 bytes) = min(max(
  (
    (
      ((averageWeightedBaseFee + averageWeightedPriorityFee) * 
      blob-submission-expected-execution-gas + averageWeightedBlobBaseFee * expected-blob-gas
    ) / bytes-per-data-submission) * profit-margin
  )
  , min-bound), max-bound)
  ```
  The `profit-margin` ensures the network is sustainable. `min-bound` and `max-bound` are variable, 
  and guarantee the gas price stays within a reasonable range.
- `previous_variable_cost` is the value of the last `ADJUSTED_VARIABLE_COST` calculation
- `delta` is a decimal number that fluctuates between `-1.0` and `1.0` and is calculated as:
  ```bash
  delta = (sum(block_calldata_size over BLOCK_COUNT) - calldata_target) / calldata_target
  ```
  Where:
  - `BLOCK_COUNT` is a constant at `5`
  - `block_calldata_size` is the total calldata size of the target block 
  - `calldata_target`  = `109,000 * BLOCK_COUNT / 2` (given that 109,000 is the maximum calldata 
    size allowed in each L2 block)
- `CHANGE_DENOMINATOR` is a constant, currently set to `32`,  designed to control the rate of change
  of `ADJUSTED_VARIABLE_COST`

### Base variable cost

The variable cost formula enables `linea_estimateGas` to price according to the variable costs of 
submitting blob data to L1, working out the per-byte cost of that data. The amount of the blob data 
in each block stays roughly consistent, though the amount _per transaction_ varies, so the 
`linea_estimateGas` API accounts for this, and ensures a gas price is returned for the transaction 
that reflects the amount of data it contains. In turn, it ensures that the network is sustainable,
and that the cost to the protocol of L1 data availability is covered. 

### Adjusted variable cost

The overarching adjusted variable cost formula enables the gas price for the end user to 
automatically adjust to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks where a malicious actor could submit
a large volume of low-compute, high-data transactions at minimal cost. In theory, such a scenario
could prevent good-faith users from submitting transactions because all of the block's space for
data would be taken up by the malicious actor's transactions.

If the calldata space of successive blocks was fully occupied, `ADJUSTED_VARIABLE_COST` would 
increase exponentially: `1 + 1 / 32` (i.e. `1 + delta / CHANGE_DENOMINATOR`) would cause the 
variable cost to double every 22 blocks (44 seconds) — 10,000x over 10 minutes. The gas cost for the
attacker — who needs to fund many transactions — would quickly snowball to a prohibitively high 
number, while remaining acceptable for regular users who only need to submit a handful of 
transactions.

This effect also works in the reverse: when calldata space usage falls, the variable cost will
exponentially decrease and eventually revert to `base_variable_cost`, depending on calldata usage.

### Variable cost and `linea_estimateGas`

To determine the priority fee per gas, `linea_estimateGas` takes the previous block's `VARIABLE_COST` 
into account:
```python
min-gas-price = previousBlock.extraData.variable_cost
baseFeePerGas = vanillaProtocolBaseFee
priorityFeePerGas = MINIMUM_MARGIN * (min-gas-price * L2_compressed_tx_size_in_bytes / L2_tx_gas_used + extraData.fixed_cost)
```

Where:
- `extraData.variable_cost` is where the previous block's `VARIABLE_COST` is stored
block
- `MINIMUM_MARGIN` varies depending on the stage of the transaction:
  - RPC method, i.e. calling `linea_estimateGas`: `1.2`
  - In the transaction pool: `0.8`
  - At transaction selection stage: `1.0`

:::note
The RPC method and transaction pool values are configurable by RPC providers or those running their 
own nodes according to preference; the transaction selection stage value is fixed. For example, 
it may be preferable to set a lower margin to facilitate lower gas prices, but this risks 
transactions not being included.
:::

`linea_estimateGas` simulates the transaction ordering logic that the sequencer uses when building 
blocks, and then obtains a gas price that will ensure that the priority fee is high enough for 
inclusion. The sequencer's transaction ordering policy includes transactions in block in order of 
highest priority fee, a system known as a priority gas auction. It also checks that the priority 
fees offered by each transaction are high enough to support network sustainability, and cover L1 
data costs.

In some cases, transactions with lower priority fees are included ahead of others with higher 
priority fees. This is because the nonce order of transactions submitted from the same account 
takes precedence. 

## [`linea_estimateGas`](../../api/reference/linea-estimategas.mdx)

`linea_estimateGas` is the recommended method for estimating gas on Linea. It returns `gasLimit`, 
`baseFeePerGas`, and `priorityFeePerGas`, and therefore provides a more precise gas estimate than 
the alternatives.

It can also help prevent transactions from being rejected due to exceeding [module limits](../../technology/prover/prover-limits.mdx).
