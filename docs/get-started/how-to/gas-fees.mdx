# Estimate transaction costs

## How gas works on Linea

Linea supports the [Ethereum EIP-1559 gas price model](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/gas):
```
total fee = units of gas used * (base fee + priority fee)
```

Linea fundamentally works exactly the same as Ethereum. The only difference is that **the base fee 
is constant at 7 wei.** Blocks created by Linea use up to 24 million gas (less than 50% of the 
maximum Linea block size of 61 million gas), and the fee decreases by 12.5% per block, keeping it 
at a stable 7 wei.

The gas cost to submit your transaction and include it on Ethereum involves the following fee 
components:

- **Layer 2 cost**: The execution fee; the cost of including your transaction on the Linea 
  sequencer, and calculated using a similar formula to Ethereum (as described above). 
- **Layer 1 cost**: The cost of publishing your L2 transaction on Ethereum, which varies 
  based on the blob fee market.

These two resource costs are abstracted by the rollup and covered by the recommended L2 gas price
and gas used.

and release notes for [Alpha v2](../../release-notes.mdx#alpha-v2) and [Alpha v3](../../release-notes.mdx#alpha-v3).

`linea_estimateGas` is the recommended method for estimating gas on Linea. See our 
[reference page](../../api/reference/linea-estimategas.mdx) for more information. 

Linea also supports:
- [`eth_estimateGas`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_estimategas)
- [`eth_gasPrice`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_gasprice)
- [`eth_feeHistory`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_feehistory).

## Gas pricing

The gas price returned by `linea_estimateGas` is based on the variable data cost of the previous 
block with a multiplier applied as a buffer to ensure inclusion.

Each Linea block's `extraData` field is populated with the following gas price values that are used 
by `linea_estimateGas` to calculate the cost of a transaction:
- A `FIXED_COST` of 0.03 Gwei, which reflects infrastructure costs;
- `VARIABLE_COST`, which is the cost per byte of data submitted to L1, and;
- `ETH_GAS_PRICE`, used to set a more accurate return value for any `eth_gasPrice` calls. 

:::note

The `extraData` field is a 32-byte space used to store arbitrary data, such as metadata or 
additional information relevant to the block. 

On Linea, it's used by the sequencer and Linea Besu nodes running the correct plugins to expose 
`linea_estimateGas`.

:::

Variable cost is calculated with the following formula:

```python
VARIABLE_COST (4 bytes) = min(max(
(
  (
    ((averageWeightedBaseFee + averageWeightedPriorityFee) * 
    blob-submission-expected-execution-gas + averageWeightedBlobBaseFee * expected-blob-gas
  ) / bytes-per-data-submission) * profit-margin
)
, min-bound), max-bound)
```

The `profit-margin` ensures the network is sustainable. `min-bound` and `max-bound` are variable, 
and guarantee the gas price stays within a reasonable range.

The variable cost formula enables `linea_estimateGas` to price according to the variable costs of 
submitting blob data to L1, working out the per-byte cost of that data. The amount of the blob data 
in each block stays roughly consistent, though the amount _per transaction_ varies, so the 
`linea_estimateGas` API accounts for this, and ensures a gas price is returned for the transaction 
that reflects the amount of data it contains. In turn, it ensures that the network is sustainable,
and that the cost to the protocol of L1 data availability is covered. 

To determine the priority fee per gas, `linea_estimateGas` takes the previous block's `VARIABLE_COST` 
into account:
```python
min-gas-price = previousBlock.extraData.variable_cost
baseFeePerGas = vanillaProtocolBaseFee
priorityFeePerGas = MINIMUM_MARGIN * (min-gas-price * L2_compressed_tx_size_in_bytes / L2_tx_gas_used + extraData.fixed_cost)
```

Where:
- `extraData.variable_cost` is where the previous block's `VARIABLE_COST` is stored
block
- `MINIMUM_MARGIN` varies depending on the stage of the transaction:
  - RPC method, i.e. calling `linea_estimateGas`: `1.2`
  - In the transaction pool: `0.8`
  - At transaction selection stage: `1.0`

:::note
The RPC method and transaction pool values are configurable by RPC providers or those running their 
own nodes according to preference; the transaction selection stage value is fixed. For example, 
it may be preferable to set a lower margin to facilitate lower gas prices, but this risks 
transactions not being included.
:::

`linea_estimateGas` simulates the transaction ordering logic that the sequencer uses when building 
blocks, and then obtains a gas price that will ensure that the priority fee is high enough for 
inclusion. The sequencer's transaction ordering policy includes transactions in block in order of 
highest priority fee, a system known as a priority gas auction. It also checks that the priority 
fees offered by each transaction are high enough to support network sustainability, and cover L1 
data costs.

In some cases, transactions with lower priority fees are included ahead of others with higher 
priority fees. This is because the nonce order of transactions submitted from the same account 
takes precedence. 

## [`linea_estimateGas`](../../api/reference/linea-estimategas.mdx)

`linea_estimateGas` is the recommended method for estimating gas on Linea. It returns `gasLimit`, 
`baseFeePerGas`, and `priorityFeePerGas`, and therefore provides a more precise gas estimate than 
the alternatives.

It can also help prevent transactions from being rejected due to exceeding [module limits](../concepts/prover/prover-limits.mdx).
