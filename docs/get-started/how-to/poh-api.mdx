Proof of Humanity was originally created to verify community members taking part in the Linea Voyage. 
It aggregates many attestation providers, giving users many options (onchain transaction history, 
biometrics, zero-knowledge KYC, etc.) to demonstrate their personhood, using the [Verax Attestation Registry](https://www.ver.ax/) 
under the hood.

Even though PoH was originally created for our own needs, the API is publicly available to the 
community. This enables projects to check and verify if an address is owned by a genuine user. It 
can be used to gate access to rewards or special services onchain (for example, to register a Linea 
Name).

To check and secure PoH status, visit the [Linea PoH page](https://poh.linea.build/).

## Offchain verification

The API endpoint for the service is: `https://linea-xp-poh-api.linea.build/`

### Usage

Call the endpoint with the format:

```
https://linea-xp-poh-api.linea.build/poh/{address}
```

For example: 

```bash
curl -X GET "https://linea-xp-poh-api.linea.build/poh/0xc5fd29cC1a1b76ba52873fF943FEDFDD36cF46C6"
```

### Response

The main focus of the response is the `poh` field:
- `false` = address does not have PoH status.
- `true` = address has PoH status.

Response schema:

```json
{
    "poh": boolean,  // Proof of Humanity status
    "isFlagged": boolean,  // Indicates PoH status
    "attestations": [
        {
        "validated": boolean,  // Whether the attestation is verified
        "issuerName": string,  // Attestation provider name
        "issuerSlugName": string,  // Unique identifier for the issuer
        "issuerDescription": string,  // Description of the attestation
        "issuerWebsiteUrl": string,  // URL to the issuerâ€™s website
        "issuerLogoUrl": string,  // Logo URL of the issuer
        "group": integer  // Category of the attestation
        }
    ]
}
```

### Reference

See the [Swagger UI](https://linea-xp-poh-api.linea.build/#/PoH/PohController_getOnePOH) for more 
information. 

## Signed onchain verification

The [PohVerifier.sol contract](https://lineascan.build/address/0xBf14cFAFD7B83f6de881ae6dc10796ddD7220831) 
can be used together with a trusted source of PoH status data.

### Usage

#### Get signed PoH status

Call the signer endpoint `https://linea-poh-signer-api.linea.build/` in the format:

```
https://linea-poh-signer-api.linea.build/poh/{address}
```

This is the _trusted source_ of PoH status data. 

For example:
```bash
curl -X GET https://linea-poh-signer-api.linea.build/poh/0xc5fd29cC1a1b76ba52873fF943FEDFDD36cF46C6
```

This returns a signed message that contains the PoH status of the provided address. For example:

```
0xa11a6c92fa0027d9de2a0c8ab363b1af083497da57f871c93aeb9efcd32ffaeb677fafb2c005e8165181713220b8a1da2f70ed31d7820b8fa086a8e7361dbf121c
```

#### Call `PohVerifier.sol`

Call the `PohVerifier.sol` smart contract's `verify()` function with the signed message and the 
address of the account being queried. The contract confirms that the signed message provided in the 
previous step was signed by the signer defined in the contract, and returns a boolean demonstrating
whether the address has PoH status.

```
verify(bytes memory signature, address human)
```

Parameters:
- `signature`: The signed message from the previous step.
- `address`: The address of the account being queried.

`verify()` returns a boolean:
- `true`: The account has PoH status.
- `false`: The account does not have PoH status.
