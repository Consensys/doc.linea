title: Get data from an oracle
description: Learn how to access price data from an oracle.
---

Web3 oracles are services that enable smart contracts and offchain code to access "real-world" 
(offchain) data, such as token prices. Without oracles, smart contracts would be restricted to using
only the data that is stored onchain, and unable to react to external inputs. 

Oracles can be accessed both onchain, by smart contracts, and offchain, in widely used languages like
JavaScript. 

In this guide, we'll focus on the most popular oracle data type: token prices.

## Use an oracle in a smart contract

### Chainlink

## Use an oracle in offchain code

### Chainlink

The Chainlink oracle product is called Data Feeds, and all the necessary smart contracts are 
available on Linea.

To query a Chainlink Data Feed, you need:
- An RPC endpoint on Linea Mainnet or Linea Sepolia
- A smart contract address for the Data Feed you want to read. 

### Get LINK on Linea

LINK is the native token of the Chainlink network and is required to pay for requests, reflecting
the service rendered by Chainlink's decentralized network of node operators.

If you want to develop on Linea Mainnet, you'll need to purchase LINK; for Linea Sepolia, a [faucet
is provided by Chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/linea-sepolia). 

### Install ethers.js

ethers.js is a JavaScript library for interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains like Linea. 

Install the npm package:

```bash
npm install ethers
```

### Find Data Feed

Chainlink maintains a registry of Data Feeds, each represented by a smart contract address. [Access it](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=linea) and ensure you filter by Linea.
