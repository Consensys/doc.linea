title: Migrate a dapp to Linea
description: An overview of the steps to move a dapp from an EVM-compatible chain to Linea.
---

Linea is EVM-equivalent, which means any dapp running on another chain compatible with the 
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can run on Linea with no changes. Accordingly, all you'll need to do 
is: 
- Duplicate your existing smart contracts and deploy them on Linea.
- Configure your dapp to interact with Linea.

## Deploy smart contracts

Your dapp's existing contracts must be deployed on Linea. [Part one](../build/quickstart/deploy.mdx) 
of our quickstart covers this, or you can pick one of multiple [contract deployment tooling guides](./deploy-smart-contract/index.mdx).

## Chain information

You may need to update your dapp with Linea chain information, which our [network information page](../build/network-info.mdx)
covers.

## RPC providers

Most major RPC providers support Linea RPC endpoints. Visit our [RPC providers page](../tooling/node-providers/index.mdx) 
for a non-exhaustive list of public and private endpoints.

:::note
Not all RPC providers support Linea-specific JSON-RPC API methods such as `linea_estimateGas`. The
node providers page details which providers do support these methods.

## Wallet connection

Multiple [libraries](../tooling/libraries), including Wagmi and Viem, support Linea wallet 
connectors. 

Check out our [wallet connection guide](../how-to/connect-wallet.mdx) for additional information.

## Moving your token

If your project has its own token, we recommend you: 

### Deploy a canonical token

[Deploy](../how-to/deploy-smart-contract/) and [verify](../how-to/verify-smart-contract/) your 
token on Linea as you would on any other EVM-compatible chain. 

### Add to the token list

With your token deployed, you should make a pull request to add it to the token shortlist on Linea's 
[canonical token list repository](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-token-list/tree/main), after 
which it will be reviewed by our team.

Being on the shortlist means that your token will be displayed in the [native bridge](https://bridge.linea.build/) 
UI. 

### Submit metadata to Lineascan

Adding token metadata to Lineascan is not essential, but strongly recommended to support a 
positive user experience. 

See the [Lineascan guide](https://info.lineascan.build/how-to-update-token-info/).

## Linea brand assets

The Linea site has a zip file of official Linea logos and icons [available for download](https://linea.build/assets),
available as both PNGs and SVGs for use in your dapp. If you need some assets or media that aren't 
covered here, please reach out on Discord.
