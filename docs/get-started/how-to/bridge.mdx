The Linea bridge app at [bridge.linea.build](https://bridge.linea.build) provides multiple ways to 
get funds onto Linea:
- **Native bridge**: Built by our team to provide an interface for the [canonical token bridge](../../technology/canonical-token-bridge.mdx). 
**Best suited for tech operators, protocols, or moving large liquidity**.
- **All bridges**: A bridge aggregator powered by Li.Fi, supporting numerous networks (EVM chains and 
Solana) and tokens. Faster than the native bridge, and the **best option for most users**.
- **Buy**: A fiat onramp aggregator provided by Onramper, enabling you to buy funds on Linea.

:::tip Testnets

Testnet bridging is only possible on the native bridge.

:::

See the below sections for instructions on each option.

## Bridge aggregator

Find the bridge aggregator under the "All Bridges" tab. It's powered by Li.Fi and supports a 
range of chains and tokens. Available networks include most major EVM networks and L2s, plus Solana. 
The optimal bridging routes are automatically selected based on your priority (speed or price, 
configurable in settings), and use a combination of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and bridges.

Transfers initiated using the bridge aggregator are much faster than those created with the native
bridge, but cost slightly more. (The same applies in reverse for the native bridge: it's slower,
but cheaper.)

For a guide on using the bridge aggregator and FAQs, see our [support guide](https://support.linea.build/bridging/how-to-bridge-to-linea).

## Native bridge

Head to the [bridge app](https://bridge.linea.build) and select the "Native Bridge" tab.

      alt="Linea native bridge tab button"
    />
  </div>
</div>

1. Select the direction of your transfer — either L1 -> L2 or L2 -> L1. 

<div class="center-container">

      alt="Linea native bridge select transfer direction"
    />
  </div>
</div>

2. Select the asset you'd like to bridge: ETH or an ERC-20 token. Available ERC-20 tokens are
based on a shortlist we maintain [here](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-token-list/tree/main/json).

:::warning

For some combinations of origin and destination chains and assets, you may need to submit an 
additional transaction on the destination network to claim your funds. This is **manual claiming**,
and is required for any transfers:
- From Linea to Ethereum (L2 -> L1)
- Involving USDC.

Automatic claiming is seleceted by default for all transfers where it is possible, and manual
claiming is automatically applied when necessary. [See below for more information](#claiming).

</div>

3. Enter the amount you'd like to bridge.

      alt="Linea native bridge select amount"
    />
  </div>
</div>

4. If needed, you can nominate a recipient address different to the origin address. To do so, click
the wallet icon in the bottom-right of the widget and input the recipient address you need:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/how_to/bridge/bridge/Linea_native_bridge_add_recipient_address_field.png"
      alt="Linea native bridge add recipient address field"
    />
  </div>
</div>

:::note Approve tokens

If you're bridging an ERC-20 token that you haven't bridged before, you'll need to complete an
additional transaction at this point to approve a spending cap before you can bridge:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/how_to/bridge/bridge/Linea_native_bridge_spending_cap_request_MetaMask_prompt3.png"
      alt="Linea native bridge spending cap request MetaMask prompt"
    />
  </div>
</div>

The spending cap enables the bridge app to access the funds you want to transfer.

:::

5. Click "Bridge", and then confirm the details and sign the transaction to proceed.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/how_to/bridge/bridge/Linea_native_bridge_confirm_and_bridge_button.png"
      alt="Linea native bridge confirm and bridge button"
    />
  </div>
</div>

After the transaction is confirmed, your bridge transfer will be visible in your transaction history,
accessible via the icon next to settings in the top-right of the widget.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img

      alt="Linea native bridge confirmed transaction history"
    />
  </div>
</div>

### Bridge USDC

USDC is handled differently by the native bridge. Since Linea has [native USDC](https://linea.mirror.xyz/VX4CIab0JP17_WLKHuf9v8bIKBHP6gLNv2etUv9UFK0), 
the bridge uses the [Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol](https://www.circle.com/cross-chain-transfer-protocol) 
(CCTP) rather than the [canonical token bridge](../../technology/canonical-token-bridge.mdx) 
elements that underpin other native bridge transfers.

USDC transfers currently require [manual claiming](#manual-claiming).

CCTP enables faster transfers. USDC transfers in both directions (L1 -> L2 _and_ L2 -> L1) typically 
complete within 20 minutes, and generally much faster. See the [CCTP documentation](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started)
for a fuller explanation.

### Claiming

The native bridge allows you to claim your bridged funds manually or automatically. 

- **Manual claiming** requires two transactions to be approved. One on the source layer to initiate 
the bridging process and the other on the target layer by the recipient to receive the funds, which 
we call "claiming". To claim, the recipient has to pay a fee on the target layer.
- **Automatic claiming** requires one transaction to be approved on the source layer. The recipient 
will automatically receive their funds because a "postman" will handle the claiming process for them.

Manual claiming is required for any transfers:
- From Linea to Ethereum (L2 -> L1)
- Involving USDC.

#### Manual claiming

Go to the transaction history page by clicking the receipt icon in the top-right of the widget.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/how_to/bridge/bridge/Linea_native_bridge_transaction_history_button.png"
      alt="Linea native bridge transaction history button"
    />
  </div>
</div>

If your manual claim transaction is ready to claim, it will be marked as "Ready to claim":

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/how_to/bridge/bridge/Linea_native_bridge_manual_ready_to_claim.png"
      alt="Transaction history entry marked as ready to claim"
    />
  </div>
</div>

When you click the transaction, you'll see its details and a "Claim" button — click it to prompt
a transaction in your wallet:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/how_to/bridge/bridge/Linea_native_bridge_claim_manual_transaction_modal.png"
      alt="Claim transaction button in modal"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Once the transaction is complete, your funds will be available in your wallet and the transaction 
history will update accordingly:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/how_to/bridge/bridge/Linea_native_bridge_manual_claim_completed.png"
      alt="Transaction history entry marked as complete"
    />
  </div>
</div>

If you encounter any issues, contact us via our [support site](https://support.linea.build) or 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/linea).

#### Configure claiming

Automatic claiming is the default option wherever possible, though for the following transfers, 
manual claiming is required:
- Linea to Ethereum (L2 -> L1)
- Any transfer involving USDC.

Although manual claiming is mandatory depending on the context, you can toggle between manual and
automatic claiming where applicable by clicking the gear icon in the "Receive" panel:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/how_to/bridge/bridge/Linea_native_bridge_advanced_settings_gear_icon.png"
      alt="Receive panel with gear icon"
    />
  </div>
</div>

The manual claiming toggle will then be available:

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src="/img/get_started/how_to/bridge/bridge/Linea_native_bridge_advanced_settings_manual_claim_toggle.png"
      alt="Manual claiming toggle"
    />
  </div>
</div>

### Execution fees

:::tip Free postman fees for L1 -> L2

The postman fee for L1 -> L2 transfers (i.e. deposits to Linea) is now sponsored for all users for 
all transfers using less than 250,000 gas, covering the majority of bridging use cases. 

This means that most automatic claiming transfers from L1 to L2 now have no fees, apart from a few 
cases [outlined above](#configure-claiming). You will, however, still need to cover the costs of 
the L1 transaction.

:::

The only fees you'll pay on the native bridge are those required to complete the transaction — 
other than network fees, the native bridge is fee-free and Linea does not profit from it.

Two types of execution fees can be applied when bridging with the native bridge: the postman fee and 
the anti-DDOS fee.

Refer to the table for which fees will apply to your bridge transfer. These fees apply to both
ETH and ERC-20 transfers. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Transaction fee</th>
        <th>Anti-DDOS fee</th>
        <th>Postman fee</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>L1 to L2 (Manual claiming)</td>
        <td>:white_check_mark:</td>
        <td>:x:</td>
        <td>:x:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>L1 to L2 (Automatic claiming)</td>
        <td>:white_check_mark:</td>
        <td>:x:</td>
        <td>:x:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>L2 to L1 (Manual claiming)</td>
        <td>:white_check_mark:</td>
        <td>:white_check_mark:</td>
        <td>:x:</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Key:
- Transaction fee: The transaction (gas) fee required for the bridge operation.
- Anti-DDOS fee: A 0.001 ETH fee applied when bridging from L2 to L1.
- Postman fee: `target layer gas price * (gas estimated + gas limit surplus) * margin`, where:
  - `target layer gas price` = `eth_gasPrice` on the target layer
  - `gas estimated` = 100,000
  - `gas limit surplus` = 6000
  - `margin` = 2
  
  Previously the postman fee was applied to automatic claiming transfers from L1 to L2, but is now 
  free.

## Buy

Under the "Buy" tab, you'll find the [Onramper](https://onramper.com/) widget, which enables you
to buy funds on Linea using fiat currency. 

For a guide on using Onramper, see [their resources](https://knowledge.onramper.com/how-to-buy-crypto-using-onramper).

Onramper is an aggregator, and aims to select the best option for your payment method, location, and
token.

KYC is required to use Onramper. 

Onramp options may differ based on your location — check the Onramper [coverage page](https://onramper.com/coverage) 
to see what's available.

## Custom options for moving large liquidity

### Use the canonical token bridge with a custom `BridgedToken` implementation

This is suited for protocols that want to implement special features for the bridged ERC-20 on L2.
**This is only possible if the token has not yet been bridged from L1 to L2 in order to avoid
unexpected changes for end-users.**

Protocols that want to use a custom BridgedToken will be able to incorporate arbitrary logic on the L2
ERC-20, while still relying on the Token Bridge lock and mint logic and cross-chain communication.
**For this to work, protocols need to keep compatibility with the Token Bridge by enabling it to 
call the ERC-20 mint and burn functions.**

If you are interested in this option, please contact the Linea team to get started. The process is 
as follows:

- The token issuer deploys a custom BridgedToken which should enable the Token Bridge to call mint 
and burn functions.
- Linea team will configure the bridge so that it will use your custom contract to mint and burn 
tokens on L2.

:::note

If you are not yet ready with your own implementation, you can deploy the standard BridgedToken 
implementation behind a dedicated upgradable proxy that you will be able to upgrade later

:::

### Build a dedicated token bridge

This is intended for partners who need full control over the bridge and want to implement complex 
cross-chain logic.

The partner will be in charge of building, auditing and operating their own token bridge.

If you are interested by this option, please get in touch with us so that we can:

- Block your L1 token from being bridged on L1 in order to avoid having several copies on Linea
- Provide guidance if you want to rely on our cross-chain messaging system
