title: Recover state from a finalized block
description: How to reconstruct Linea's state as it was at a given block number.
---

In the highly unlikely event that Linea's sequencer fails, it must be possible to reconstruct
Linea's state as it was at the last point in time data was finalized, using L1 data. Conceivably,
any entity could then resume transacton sequencing, confident that state was resuming from the 
correct point. 

State recovery insures against the risks of a single point of failure that could cripple the network.
Since this system can be used by any independent actor to validate state roots against L1-published 
data, it also reduces the need for trust in the Linea [sequencer and coordinator](../../technology/architecture.mdx).

To this end, the Linea Besu execution client has a state recovery plugin that:

1. Retrieves finalized blobs from L1; 
2. Decompresses the blob data;
3. Replays the transactions in the execution client, and, finally,
4. Checks that the resulting `stateRootHash` matches the one finalized on L1. 

Linea Besu executes the fetched transactions in the blob, while the state management plugin, Shomei, 
rebuilds state.

## Prerequisites

:::note Availability

The state recovery plugin only works from the following block numbers onwards:
- Linea Mainnet: TBC (once Beta v2 is live)
- Linea Sepolia: `9572301` (the block where the 2B gas limit was implemented)

:::

The Linea Besu node being used must have been running with the following configuration in the `.toml` 
file since genesis (i.e. from when it started to sync):
- [`FULL`](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/concepts/node-sync#full-synchronization) sync
mode:
    ```toml
    sync-mode="FULL"
    ```
- [`BONSAI`](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/reference/cli/options#data-storage-format) 
data storage:
    ```toml
    data-storage-format="BONSAI"
    ```


To learn how to run a Linea Besu node, see our [guide](../how-to/run-a-node/linea-besu.mdx).

## Update configuration

To proceed with state recovery, your node must have been running normally, in line with the above 
conditions (i.e. `FULL` sync mode and `BONSAI` data storage enabled).

Only then can you proceed by adding the following configuration parameters.

Insert them into the `.toml` configuration file alongside any existing plugin configurations:

```toml
### Plugin Configuration ###

plugin-staterecovery-blobscan-endpoint="https://api.sepolia.blobscan.com"
plugin-staterecovery-overriding-recovery-start-block-number=9572301
```

:::note

The `plugin-staterecovery-l1-endpoint` parameter assumes that you have the variable `INFURA_APP_KEY` 
stored in your environment. If not, or if you want to use a different RPC endpoint, ensure you
update this.

:::

`plugin-staterecovery-overriding-recovery-start-block-number=9572301` will instruct the client to
sync as normal, via P2P, until block `9572300`, the block before the one specified. After this, it 
will begin using the state recovery plugin and sync based on data recovered from L1 blobs.
