# Fund your wallet

Use [MetaMask](Getting started with MetaMask) to store your funds and interact with the
ConsenSys zkEVM network. You can [install MetaMask as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/).

You need to [bridge Goerli ETH to the ConsenSys zk-EVM network](bridge-funds.md) to interact with the network.

Use a faucet to obtain Goerli ETH. Transactions are much cheaper than mainnet, therefore 0.1 ETH is enough
to execute a basic workflow. You can [view a list of faucets](https://faucetlink.to/goerli)
for the Goerli network.
