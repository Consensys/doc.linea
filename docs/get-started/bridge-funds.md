# Bridge your funds

Use the ConsenSys zkEVM token bridge to bridge funds (in ETH) between Goerli and the ConsenSys zkEVM network.

## Goerli to ConsenSys zkEVM

Ensure your [MetaMask wallet has funds](fund.md) and is [configured](configure-metamask.md) to
use the ConsenSys zkEVM network.

Perform the following steps to bridge your Goerli ETH to ConsenSys zkEVM:

1. Access the bridge on the Goerli testnet.
1. In the top drop-down select **Goerli**, and in the bottom drop-down select **ConsenSys zkEVM**.
1. Select the **ETH** token.
1. Click **Send**.

    !!! important

        First time users need to approve the ConsenSys zkEVM bridge to allow the transfer of your test ETH.

1. In the MetaMask window, confirm the transfer.

The sent amount is deducted from your Goerli account on MetaMask. Switch to the ConsenSys zkEVM
network in your wallet to view the bridged funds.

You can now use the funds on ConsenSys zkEVM to transfer funds between accounts or interact with
smart contracts on the network. For example, use the Uniswap v3 protocol that's deployed on the
network.

## ConsenSys zkEVM to Goerli

Ensure that you [added the ConsenSys zkEVM network to MetaMask](configure-metamask.md) and have
Goerli ETH in your account on the ConsenSys zkEVM network.

Perform the following steps to bridge your Goerli ETH from ConsenSys zkEVM to Goerli:

1. Access the bridge on the Goerli testnet.
1. In the top drop-down select **ConsenSys zkEVM**, and in the bottom drop-down select **Goerli**.
1. Select the **ETH** token.
1. Click **Send**.
1. In the MetaMask window, confirm the transfer.

The sent amount is deducted from your account on ConsenSys zkEVM. Switch to the Goerli network in
your wallet to view the bridged funds.
