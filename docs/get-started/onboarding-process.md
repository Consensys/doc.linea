# Onboarding process

To ensure the system is secure and stable, we are gradually onboarding new users in the order
signed up to the wait-list. The number of daily onboarded users vary, but we'll try to onboard everyone
who signed up as quick as possible.

!!! information

    You need an Infura account to access the ConsenSys zkEVM network. You can create your Infura account
    before, or after joining the wait-list.

The process to onboard to the ConsenSys zkEVM network is as follows:

1. [Join the wait-list](https://www.infura.io/resources/network/consensys-zkevm-beta-signup). If you're
    an existing Infura user, use the same email address registered with Infura to simplify the
    onboarding process.

    !!! important

        If you're a registered Infura user who has opted-out of receiving email communication, you'll
        receive a warning in the signup page saying, `LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE OPTED OUT OF EMAIL COMMUNICATION.
        CLICK HERE TO GET AN EMAIL AND OPT BACK IN`.

        We recommend you opt back in because you'll receive email communication
        from Infura when you've been given network access.

1. If you're a registered Infura user, you'll receive an Infura email confirming your place on the waiting list.

    If you're not a registered Infura user, you'll receive an email with the steps required to
    participate in the ConsenSys zkEVM private beta. You must create a free Infura account to be eligible
    for testing ConsenSys zkEVM.

1. Receive an email confirming access to ConsenSys zkEVM. This email provides instructions on how to
    access your unique RPC URL.

You can now use the RPC URL in Infura to configure MetaMask and begin testing the network. Follow the
[testing environment setup](https://goerli.zkevm.consensys.net/) to set up MetaMask and bridge funds
to ConsenSys zkEVM to start testing.

!!! note

    We recommended testing ConsenSys zkEVM on a desktop browser rather than tablet or mobile.
