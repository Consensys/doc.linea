# Onboarding process

To ensure the system is secure and stable, we are gradually onboarding new users in the order signed up to the waitlist. The number of daily onboarded users vary, but we'll try to onboard everyone who signed up as quick as possible.

:::info

You need an Infura account to access the ConsenSys zkEVM network. You can create your Infura account before or after joining the waitlist.

:::

The process to onboard to the ConsenSys zkEVM network is as follows:

1.  [Join the waitlist](https://www.infura.io/resources/network/consensys-zkevm-beta-signup). If you're an existing Infura user, use the same email address registered with Infura to simplify the onboarding process.

    :::caution

    If you're a registered Infura user who has opted out of receiving email communication, you'll receive a warning in the sign-up page saying, `LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE OPTED OUT OF EMAIL COMMUNICATION. CLICK HERE TO GET AN EMAIL AND OPT BACK IN`.

    We recommend you opt back in because you'll receive email communication from Infura when you've been given network access.

    :::

2.  If you're a registered Infura user, you'll receive an Infura email confirming your place on the waiting list.

    If you're not a registered Infura user, you'll receive an email with the steps required to participate in the ConsenSys zkEVM private beta. You must create a free Infura account to be eligible for testing ConsenSys zkEVM.

3.  After you've been onboarded you'll receive an email confirming access to ConsenSys zkEVM. This email provides instructions on how to access your unique RPC URL.

You can now use the RPC URL in Infura to configure MetaMask and begin testing the network. Follow the [testing environment setup](https://goerli.zkevm.consensys.net/) to set up MetaMask and bridge funds to ConsenSys zkEVM to start testing.

:::note

We recommend testing ConsenSys zkEVM on a desktop browser rather than tablet or mobile.
