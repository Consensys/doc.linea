:::info[WIP]

This section is being built out to support users to run the Linea stack independently to create a dedicated private Linea deployment.

:::

Enterprises may leverage a private Linea deployment to support a shared, extensible foundation for the next generation of regulated, low-cost, near-instant settlement payment flows.

## Solving for the silos

The connectivity between tokenized and traditional financial rails remains fragmented, preventing large-scale adoption of blockchain-based financial infrastructure.

A private Linea instance, a Linea Validium, addresses this need by providing a compliant, high-throughput, EVM-equivalent execution environment that is trustlessly anchored to its finalization layer while preserving transaction privacy. 

By combining open standards, zero-knowledge proofs, and role-based access control into a production-capable architecture, Linea Validium enables regulated institutions to issue, manage, and settle digital assets at scale, while maintaining interoperability with private networks and public blockchains. 

## Supporting regulation 

Regulated financial institutions and their customers increasingly demand the benefits of non-custodial, open finance: programmable assets, global reach, and real-time settlement. However, traditional finance functions like Know Your Customer/Know Your Trade (KYC/KYT) compliance, governance, and controlled access are only partially replicated in non-custodial environments. 

Linea Validium offers these advantages while supporting regulatory compliance, and without sacrificing operational reliability or privacy.

This section will present Linea Validium's scalable, production-capable digital ledger architecture.

Linea Validium is currently a prototype on testnet. This documentation is subject to change based on the outcomes of testing.
