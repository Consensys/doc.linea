### Bridging is crucial to the Linea network and the ecosystem it supports.

As such, there is a robust and growing set of bridges operating on Linea.

The Linea team operates the official Canonical Token Bridge, optimized for
technical partners. Many of those partners are bridges themselves, and the Linea
team encourage users to take advantage of these bridges, and not to rely on ours
alone.

More details on the Canonical Token Bridge and how it works can be found
[here](./canonical-token-bridge.mdx).
