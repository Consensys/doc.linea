Linea uses module limits to keep proof complexity manageable and ensure that the prover can
generate proofs efficiently without overwhelming the infrastructure. 

Linea's arithmetization specification is divided into modules, and each module represents a collection
of EVM or Linea zkEVM operations (opcodes). Modules can:
- Process transaction data.
- Manage zkEVM memory.
- Coordinate interactions between modules.

Each module has a specific limit on the number of lines of data its operations can generate, 
regardless of its purpose. You can view these limits in the 
[Linea source code](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/blob/main/config/common/traces-limits-besu-v2.toml). 
Additional lines are generated each time unique instructions are provided to a module's operations, 
but repeat calls with the same arguments do not generate new lines.

High-complexity transactions that repeatedly use a large volume of operations may generate too many 
lines of data and exceed a module's limit. Transactions that reach this point are rejected by the 
[sequencer](../sequencer/index.mdx) to ensure that the trace data passed to the prover is of a 
manageable scope, and that a proof can be generated.

Transactions rejected for exceeding module limits can be identified through the following
methods, which return an error:

- [`linea_estimateGas`](../../../developers/reference/api/linea-estimategas.mdx)
- [`eth_sendRawTransaction`](../../../developers/reference/api/eth-sendrawtransaction.mdx)

Use [`linea_getTransactionExclusionStatusV1`](../../../developers/reference/api/linea-gettransactionexclusionstatusv1.mdx)
to get the rejection status of a transaction hash, if it was sent and didn't get rejected directly, 
nor included in a block.

This API method can be used to query the reason for transaction rejection in edge cases where
`linea_estimateGas` or `eth_sendRawTransaction` did not return an error. It's intended to be used 
only in cases the transaction execution differs between an RPC node and the sequencer.
