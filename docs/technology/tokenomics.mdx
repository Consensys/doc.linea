The LINEA token is designed to grow and support Ethereum and Linea, and has several radical features 
that set it apart from most layer 2 tokens:
- ETH is the gas token
- LINEA does not come with any governance rights
- There is no token allocation for insiders, investors, or team members.

Instead, LINEA will help to organically grow the chain by being distributed to users as a reward for 
using apps and protocols on Linea. 

## Allocation

LINEA will have a **total supply of 72,009,990,000**. This 1,000x the genesis supply of ETH on 
Ethereum.

85% of the supply of LINEA will be be invested in the community and ecosystem, comprising the 
Ecosystem Fund, with 15% held long-term by Consensys.

The supply will be allocated according to the below table:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Category</th>
		<th>% of supply</th>
		<th>Details</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ecosystem</td>
		<td>85%</td>
		<td>75% for a long-term Ecosystem Fund, and 10% for early contributors.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Consensys treasury</td>
		<td>15%</td>
		<td>Locked (non-transferrable) for five years. Consensys will hold the tokens long-term for 
		alignment and to support Linea and its ecosystem.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Except from the initial allocation to Consensys, which is locked for five years, there is **no 
allocation to private investors, insiders, or employees and team members**. Instead, value is 
funneled straight into the ecosystem, the builders bringing it to fruition, and the community members 
engaging with it. 

At the time of the token generation event (TGE), 22% of the LINEA supply will be in circulation, 
split between a user and builder airdrop, ecosystem activations, and liquidity provisioning.

All other allocations will be locked at TGE, or vesting according to various schedules.

## Ecosystem (85%)

### Early contributors (10%)

The initial airdrop for early contributors, comprising 10% of the supply, will include:
- 9% to early contributors
- 1% to strategic builders

The early contributor airdrop for users will be based on onchain activity over the long term, including 
LXP. An eligibility checker will be available before TGE. The 1% allocation for builders will be 
distributed through a curated, targeted process for maximum impact.
	
All tokens distributed through the above airdrops are fully unlocked.

### Ecosystem Fund (75%)

The long-term section of the Ecosystem Fund will be managed by the Linea Consortium.

This 75% will unlock over 10 years, with unlocks weighted towards the earlier years to encourage 
early activation and adoption. Unlocks occur early â€” 10% per year in the early years, tapering to 2% 
by the tenth year.

These funds will be used for:
- Funding for Ethereum R&D
- Maintaining shared ecosystem infrastructure such as audits, developer tools, and node infrastructure
- Funding public goods, such as open-source software, research, and community programs
- Strategic co-development with aligned organizations or emerging protocols.

## Consensys treasury (15%)

15% of the total token supply will be incorporated into the Consensys treasury. This allocation will 
be locked for five years and is non-transferrable until a vesting schedule is complete.

## Burning mechanism

Linea and the LINEA token are designed specifically to reinforce the strength of Ethereum and ETH, 
achieved through an automatic, dual-burn mechanism:
- All gas fees on Linea are paid in ETH
- 20% of net ETH profits (Linea revenue minus operating costs and subsidies) will be burned, 
  reducing ETH supply
- 80% of net ETH profits are used to burn LINEA, reducing LINEA supply.

As a result, network activity on Linea directly supports both the value of ETH and LINEA.
