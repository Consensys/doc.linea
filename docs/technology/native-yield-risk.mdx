description: A transparent risk disclosure covering Linea's Native Yield system
---

[Native Yield](https://linea.build/blog/introducing-native-yield-sustainable-defi-rewards-from-bridged-eth) 
is a system that rewards providing liquidity on Linea by automatically staking bridged ETH and 
redistributing the proceeds to liquidity providers. Rather than a passive asset, ETH bridged to 
Linea is productive, all while improving the core DeFi experience for users through deeper liquidity. 
Anyone who bridges ETH to Linea Mainnet from Ethereum Mainnet is a participant in Native Yield.

As with most DeFi protocols and systems, Native Yield is not risk-free. However, it has been designed
with trust-minimization as a guiding principle, meaning participants don't have to trust Native Yield-affiliated 
organization such as Linea and Lido; instead, the information and risks are shared transparently so 
they can verify the system for themselves.

This page is intended to describe Native Yield's risks — and mitigations — in a simple and 
transparent way, equipping prospective participants with the information they need to make their own, 
informed decisions.

Please read this page alongside Linea's general [risk disclosures](../risk-disclosures/index.mdx).

## Risk 1: Loss of funds

### Lido governance

Native Yield uses the [stVault](https://v3.lido.fi/) system developed by Lido to stake ETH on Linea.
There is a fundamental risk that, if something were to interfere with Lido's governance or operations,
Native Yield participants could lose funds. For example:
- A privileged entity with access to the stVault could seize funds.
- Lido smart contracts could be upgraded to change how they function, enabling funds loss.

These risks are mitigated by:
- **The stVault's non-custodial model**. Node Operators — the automated entities that manage staking —
  have no access to the staked ETH. Even if compromised or manipulated by a malicious actor, 
  they cannot take control of ETH staked on Linea.
- **Lido's Dual Governance model**. Lido is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), 
  but all the decisions it takes to upgrade (alter) its smart contracts can be delayed by holders of 
  [stETH](https://support.metamask.io/manage-crypto/earn/stake/liquid-staking/what-are-lido-steth-and-stmatic), 
  the liquid staking token that Lido users receive in exchange for staking ETH. The delays enable
  stETH holders to exit the protocol before the upgrade, if they choose. This system incentivizes
  the DAO to make decisions that benefit stakers — in this context, users depositing ETH to Linea —
  rather than risk losing them. 
- **"Escape hatch"**. stVaults are designed with an "escape hatch" mechanism that enables the vault
  owner — in our case, the Linea Security Council — to completely uncouple from the Lido DAO. The 
  escape hatch can be activated quickly, enabling prompt action in response to DAO voting. 
- **GateSeal**. Lido also has a [GateSeal](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/gate-seal/) mechanism that
  enables a small multisig committee (a wallet where transactions can only be signed by at least half 
  of the signatories; in this case, 3 of 6) to instantly pause important Lido smart contracts for a
  defined, 11-day period. In the event of an exploit, this would mitigate funds loss and buy time for
  Lido's DAO to respond.

### Slashing

Staked ETH is subject to a process called slashing, where some (or all, in extreme cases) of a 
validator's staked ETH is seized ("slashed") if they operate poorly or maliciously. Slashing 
incentivizes validators to act in accordance with rules that benefit stakers and the wider network.

Since Native Yield involves staking ETH, there is a risk that validators selected by the Node 
Operator do not fulfil their duties, and have some of their stake slashed. While a small amount of 
slashed ETH would be unlikely to affect any single Native Yield participant, and only ~0.04% of 
Ethereum Mainnet validators have ever been slashed, it's still possible that multiple validators
could be slashed simultaneously. This would reduce the amount of ETH available to the Native Yield 
Operator that manages the overall system, and could therefore impact the ability of Native Yield 
participants to withdraw ETH (bridge back to Ethereum Mainnet). 

These risks are mitigated by:
- **Node Operator selection process**. Node Operators will only be selected if they have never had 
  a slashing incident, and otherwise operate their nodes to an extremely high standard.
- **Slashing insurance fund**. A portion of the Node Operator fees will be temporarily retained to 
  create an insurance fund that can be used to compensate any Native Yield participants that lose
  funds as a result of slashing. 

### stETH price risk 

The design of Native Yield means that users do not receive stETH, Lido's liquid staking token, in
normal circumstances. stETH will only be minted in the rare situation where the Native Yield ETH 
buffer, which facilitates required withdrawals from Linea, runs out. In this situation, users can 
choose to withdraw their funds as stETH or wait for the buffer to be refilled.

stETH is redeemable for ETH with the core Lido protocol at a 1:1 rate, meaning it is essentially 
pegged to the value of ETH (its value is more or less identical). However, if the value of stETH 
drops below the value of ETH, Lido must rebalance by withdrawing staked ETH to maintain cover the 
difference, and enable stETH holders to redeem 1:1 for ETH.

The end result is a temporary reduction in the amount of ETH in the vault, and therefore a 
temporary reduction in rewards that can be distributed to Native Yield participants. There is no 
risk to the underlying capital in the vault: the staked ETH. Native Yield participants are therefore
insulated from the price risks of stETH.

## Risk 2: Delayed or censored withdrawals

### Dependence on permissioned roles

It's critical that Native Yield participants can permissionlessly withdraw funds at any time. In 
other systems similar to Linea Native Yield, such as Blast, require a permissioned administrator
to approve each step of the withdrawal. 

Native Yield is designed to minimize any withdrawal friction, reducing the risk that user funds are
temporarily locked into the system. Potentially frozen funds are mitigated by purposely **restricting
the Native Yield Operator's responsibilities.** The Native Yield Operator manages the liquidity 
buffer, stakes and unstakes funds, and generally maintains vault solvency. Crucially, the Native 
Yield Operator does not facilitate withdrawals and cannot move funds in or out of the vault itself. 
This means participants can withdraw without the approval of any other entity, making the system 
permissionless.

### Withdrawal delays 

Withdrawing funds from the Native Yield system simply requires participants to bridge them back to
Ethereum Mainnet. However, this action relies on there being sufficient liquid funds available to 
absorb withdrawal demand — withdrawing staked ETH takes time (~1 week), and would cause delays if 
it had to be relied upon. If available liquidity is ever exhausted, such as in an extreme "bank run" 
scenario, participants would be unable to exit the system when they want, and would need to wait for 
the buffer to be refilled. 

There is, therefore, a risk that the buffer could be exhausted, and that users are unable to withdraw
funds from Linea. This is mitigated through: 
- **Managing the liquidity buffer**. Only a portion of deposited ETH is actually staked; the rest is
  held in the liquidity buffer and managed according to activity, ensuring enough remains available.
  The size of the buffer covers expected withdrawal volume plus a significant safety margin, and the 
  Native Yield Operator dynamically tops up the buffer by unstaking ETH.
- **stETH withdrawals**. In an extreme scenario where the liqudity buffer is exhausted, users will 
  not be forced to wait for it to be refilled. Instead, they'll have the option to withdraw their 
  funds as stETH rather than wait for ETH to be unstaked and added to the liquidity buffer. Because 
  of this system, there is always an option for immediate liquidity; even in extreme cases, 
  particpants can withdraw funds. 

Despite these systems, the Ethereum validator unstaking queue is a potential bottleneck that we 
cannot control. If unstaking demand is high across the Ethereum ecosystem, this may impact 
participants' ability to withdraw funds from Linea.
