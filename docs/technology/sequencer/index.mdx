## What is it?

The sequencer is the heart of Linea's execution client, responsible for **ordering, building, and executing blocks** in a way that allows the subsequent zero-knowledge proof to be made.

## What does it do?

The sequencer does a number of things: 

- Determines the order—the _sequence_—in which transactions will be executed 
- Builds blocks from them 
- Executes those blocks 
- Prepares certain data relating to the _traces_ of that execution for the zero-knowledge prover.

## How does it do it?

Linea's execution client is [Linea Besu](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu), an 
implementation of the Besu execution client extended with additional functionality to support
Linea and its requirements as a zero-knowledge rollup. You can [run your own Linea Besu node](../../get-started/how-to/run-a-node/linea-besu.mdx). 

Linea's sequencer takes transactions from the Linea memory pool, and builds them into blocks. However, 
on Linea, it also does a bit of extra work, and communication, with the coordinator, to ensure that 
blocks are made in such a way that they can be proven by the zero-knowledge prover, and that they 
are as compact as possible-doubly important in a situation where all data has to be written in 
tiny, costly pieces on Ethereum Mainnet. This is done specifically by subsystems within the 
sequencer: the traces generator and conflator.
