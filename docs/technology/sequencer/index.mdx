## The sequencer

### What is it?

The sequencer is the heart of Linea's execution client, responsible for **ordering, building, and executing blocks** in a way that allows the subsequent zero-knowledge proof to be made.

### What does it do?

The sequencer does a number of things: 

- Determines the order—the _sequence_—in which transactions will be executed 
- Builds blocks from them 
- Executes those blocks 
- Prepares certain data relating to the _traces_ of that execution for the zero-knowledge prover.

### How does it do it?

Currently, Linea's execution client is zkGeth, a version of geth that has been modified to work with zk-proving technology. However, Linea is building **linea-besu**: leveraging the full power of the Consensys stack by using the same Besu client software that is used to execute blocks on Ethereum coupled with a plugin system. You can [run your own Linea Besu node](../../get-started/how-to/run-a-node/linea-besu.mdx). 

Linea's sequencer takes transactions from the Linea memory pool, and builds them into blocks, just like Besu does on mainnet Ethereum. However, on Linea, it also does a bit of extra work, and communication, with the coordinator, to ensure that blocks are made in such a way that they can be proven by the zero-knowledge prover, and that they are as compact as possible-doubly important in a situation where all data has to be written in tiny, costly pieces on Ethereum Mainnet. This is done specifically by subsystems within the Sequencer: the traces generator and conflator.
