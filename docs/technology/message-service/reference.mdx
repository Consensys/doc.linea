# Canonical message service technical reference

The message service is responsible for cross-chain messages between Ethereum and Linea, which:

- Allows a contract on the source layer to safely interact with a contract on the target layer 
(e.g. L1TokenBridge triggering mint on the L2TokenBridge),
- Is responsible for bridging ETH (native currency on L1 and L2)
- Supports:
  - **push**: auto-execution on target layer if a fee is paid
  - **pull**: users/protocols responsible for triggering the transaction

## Usage

### Step 1: `sendMessage()`

Call `sendMessage()` on the origin layer using the proxy contract at one of the contract addresses 
[above](#contracts).

<details>

<summary>Proxy contract?</summary>

A proxy contract is one that simply points towards the actual "implementation" contracts. This model
is beneficial as it allows the implementation contracts to be upgraded independently of the proxy,
allowing contract upgrades without having to start afresh and lose the proxy contract's history. 
When the implementation contracts are updated, the proxy contract is simply amended to point 
towards the new implementation contract addresses.

</details>

`sendMessage()` takes the following arguments:

- `_to`: the destination address on the destination layer
- `_fee`: the message service fee on the origin layer. 
  - An optional field used to incentivize a postman to perform `claimMessage(...)` automatically 
  on the destination layer (not available when bridging from L2 to L1, or for non-ETH transfers)
- `_calldata`: a flexible field that is generally created using `abi.encode(...)`

<details>

  <summary>What is the `_fee`?</summary>

  **L1 -> L2:**
  - Automatic claiming: 0 (The postman fee is sponsored by Linea.)
  - Manual claiming: 0

  :::note

  The postman fee for automatic claiming is only sponsored for transactions using less than 
  250,000 gas. Where sponsorship doesn't apply, the postman fee = `target layer gas price * (gas 
  estimated + gas limit surplus) * margin`, where:

  - `target layer gas price` = `eth_gasPrice` on the target layer
  - `gas estimated` = the current gas estimation
  - `gas limit surplus` = 6000
  - `margin` = 2

  :::

  **L2 -> L1:**
  - Manual claiming: 0.001 ETH (anti-DDOS fee)

  _Automatic claiming is not available for L2 -> L1._

  See our [main bridge page](../../get-started/how-to/bridge.mdx) for more information on the 
  execution fees that apply.

</details>

### Step 2: Claim messages

Once the message is sent, you must execute the message on the destination layer by claiming it.

#### Option 1: Run a postman

You can run a postman locally or as part of a dapp to claim messages. This can be useful if messages 
don't get picked up by the Linea postman because there was no fee attached or the fee was too low, 
for example. Event filtering, detailed below, also makes it possible to filter for messages
that relate to specific criteria, such as messages sent on a specific dapp.

Run a postman by cloning the [Linea monorepo](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo) 
locally and following the instructions in the [postman README](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/tree/main/postman#readme).

You can trigger a manual claim via the postman by:

1. **Event filtering**: Run the postman with event filtering configuration that instructs it to 
listen only for messages that meet certain criteria. Configure the event filtering in your local 
`.env` file (available as `env.sample` when you clone the monorepo): 
    - `L1_EVENT_FILTER_FROM_ADDRESS`: Filter events using a `from` address
    - `L1_EVENT_FILTER_TO_ADDRESS`: Filter events using a `to` address
    - `L1_EVENT_FILTER_CALLDATA`: Filter by the contents of event calldata using a [Filtrex](https://github.com/joewalnes/filtrex/tree/master) 
    expression. For example: `calldata.funcSignature == "0x6463fb2a" and calldata.params.messageNumber == 85804`
    - `L1_EVENT_FILTER_CALLDATA_FUNCTION_INTERFACE`: Filter by the calldata data function interface, 
    following this format: `"function transfer(address to, uint256 amount)"`. Make sure you specify 
    parameter names in order, using syntax like `calldata.params.messageNumber`.

2. **`claimMessage`**: This call is made automatically by the postman if the configuration is 
correct. If, however, gas exceeds 250,000 (the threshold for postman fee sponsorship), you will 
need to call one of these methods using the parameters detailed in the [interface below](#interface-imessageservicesol):
    - L2: `claimMessage` 
    - L1: `claimMessageWithProof`

#### Option 2: Use the Linea SDK

The [Linea SDK](../../api/linea-sdk.mdx) (view the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@consensys/linea-sdk?activeTab=readme))
simplifies the execution of messages on the destination layer.

Install the SDK using the package manager of your choice. For example:

```bash
npm install @consensys/linea-sdk
```

Refer to the [SDK README](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/tree/main/sdk#readme) for 
directions on initializing the SDK and enabling read-write mode. 

Now you can use the `claim()` function on the destination layer to claim messages, passing the 
message hash as an argument:

```js
const tx = await l2Contract.claim(message);
```

You can call `claim()` either on the `l1Contract` or `l2Contract` depending on which you need.
