- Privacy-preserving execution models (private validium)
- Selective disclosure implementations
- Controlled access to state and data
- Integration with external compliance and monitoring systems

## Define data retention and selective disclosure

### Protocol support 

Linea suppors customization:

- State commitment retention rules

### Deployment controls 

Operators can configure data retention and selective disclosure to their business rules:

- Data retention and deletion policies
