The Linea protocol and operator stack offers certain security capabilities. Such capabilities are provided through both protocol guarantees and operator-controlled integrations.

## Define security capabilities

Linea provides protocol-level guarantees, while operators implement operational controls.

### Protocol-level guarantees 

The Linea protocol offers certain security guarantees:

- Cryptographic correctness guarantees via zk-SNARKs
- Byzantine fault tolerant consensus (QBFT)
- Finalization security inherited from the finalization layer
- Protocol-level security invariants

### Operational security integrations 

Operators retain full control over their secure boundaries:

- Infrastructure isolation and network security controls
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for APIs and services
- Secure key management via KMS-backed signing and remote signing through [Web3Signer](../../protocol/architecture#web3signer)
- Monitoring and incident response tooling
