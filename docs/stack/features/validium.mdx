Private Validium is a deployment model for the Linea stack that keeps transaction data offchain while
maintaining cryptographic guarantees through zero-knowledge proofs. It is designed for regulated
financial institutions and applications requiring privacy, compliance controls, and selective data
disclosure.

## Key features

### Offchain data availability

Transaction data is stored offchain in a private node set rather than posted to the finalization
layer. Only state commitments and zero-knowledge proofs are posted onchain, ensuring transaction
privacy while maintaining cryptographic guarantees.

### Role-based access control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) controls access to network functionality:

- RPC endpoints: Access controlled by API keys and permissions
- API portal: Institution-level access controls
- Transaction visibility: Participants see only transactions they're authorized to view

### Privacy and compliance

Private Validium supports regulated financial applications:

- Transaction privacy: Transaction details not visible on finalization layer
- Selective disclosure: Authorized parties (auditors, regulators) can access transaction data
- KYC/KYT controls: Compliance checks can be enforced at the API and sequencer levels
- Audit trails: Complete audit trails while maintaining privacy

### API portal

The API portal provides controlled access to network functionality:

- Institution onboarding and management
- Token issuance and management
- Settlement workflows (CBP, PVP, DVP)
- Balance queries and reporting

### Finalization layer options

Private Validium can finalize on:

- Ethereum L1: direct finalization on Ethereum with higher costs and longer finality times
- Linea Mainnet: finalization on Linea Mainnet with lower costs and faster finality

See [deployment models](../how-it-works/deployment-models.mdx) for a comparison of finalization
layer options.

## Use cases

Private Validium is ideal for:

- Regulated financial institutions: Banks, payment processors, and financial market
  infrastructures requiring compliance and privacy
- Multi-party workflows: Applications where participants should not see all transaction details
- Tokenized assets: Issuance and settlement of tokenized securities and cash
- Cross-border payments: Settlement systems requiring privacy and compliance controls

## Architecture

Private Validium deployments include:

- Consensus layer: [Maru](../../protocol/reference/repos.mdx#maru) with Quorum-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT) consensus (minimum 4 nodes)
- Execution layer: [Linea Besu](../../protocol/reference/repos.mdx#linea-besu-upstream) with sequencer plugins
- [Coordinator](../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx): Orchestrates proof generation and
  [finalization](../../network/overview/known-finality-state.mdx)
- [Prover](../../protocol/architecture/prover/index.mdx): Generates zero-knowledge proofs
- [State manager](../../protocol/architecture/state-manager.mdx): Maintains state for proof generation
- Private RPC nodes: RBAC-protected RPC endpoints
- API portal: Controlled access to network functionality
- Data availability: Private node set for data storage

## Security and trust

### Trust assumptions

Private Validium requires trust in:

- Data availability providers: Must make data available when needed
- Validator set: Must follow consensus protocol (QBFT provides fault tolerance)
- Finalization layer: Inherits security from Ethereum

### Security features

- Minimum node count: 4 nodes for QBFT fault tolerance
- Access controls: Role-Based Access control (RBAC) on RPC and API endpoints
- Key management: Supports [Web3Signer](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx#web3signer) remote signing backed
  by a hardware security module (HSM) or key management service (KMS)
- Network isolation: Private network topology

## Data availability

### Node-based data availability

Initial deployments use a private node set for data storage. Participants must trust that data
availability providers will make data available when needed.
