Private Validium is a deployment model for The Linea stack that keeps transaction data offchain while
maintaining cryptographic guarantees through zero-knowledge proofs. It is designed for regulated
financial institutions and applications requiring privacy, compliance controls, and selective data
disclosure.

## Key features

### Offchain data availability

Transaction data is stored offchain in a private node set rather than posted to the finalization
layer. Only state commitments and zero-knowledge proofs are posted onchain, ensuring transaction
privacy while maintaining cryptographic guarantees.

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

RBAC controls access to network functionality:

- **RPC endpoints**: Access controlled by API keys and permissions
- **API portal**: Institution-level access controls
- **Transaction visibility**: Participants see only transactions they're authorized to view

### Privacy and compliance

Private Validium supports regulated financial applications:

- **Transaction privacy**: Transaction details not visible on finalization layer
- **Selective disclosure**: Authorized parties (auditors, regulators) can access transaction data
- **KYC/KYT controls**: Compliance checks can be enforced at the API and sequencer levels
- **Audit trails**: Complete audit trails while maintaining privacy

### API portal

The API portal provides controlled access to network functionality:

- Institution onboarding and management
- Token issuance and management
- Settlement workflows (CBP, PVP, DVP)
- Balance queries and reporting

### Finalization layer options

Private Validium can finalize on:

- **Ethereum L1**: Direct finalization on Ethereum with higher costs and longer finality times
- **Linea Mainnet**: Finalization on Linea Mainnet with lower costs and faster finality

See [Deployment Models](/stack/how-it-works/deployment-models/options) for a comparison of finalization
layer options.

## Use cases

Private Validium is ideal for:

- **Regulated financial institutions**: Banks, payment processors, and financial market
  infrastructures requiring compliance and privacy
- **Multi-party workflows**: Applications where participants should not see all transaction details
- **Tokenized assets**: Issuance and settlement of tokenized securities and cash
- **Cross-border payments**: Settlement systems requiring privacy and compliance controls

## Architecture

Private Validium deployments include:

- **Consensus layer**: [Maru](/protocol/repos#maru) with QBFT consensus (minimum 4 nodes)
- **Execution layer**: [Linea Besu](/protocol/repos#linea-besu-upstream) with sequencer plugins
- **[Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator)**: Orchestrates proof generation and finalization (see [Transaction lifecycle](/protocol/transaction-lifecycle) for details)
- **[Prover](/protocol/prover)**: Generates zero-knowledge proofs
- **[State manager](/protocol/state-manager)**: Maintains state for proof generation
- **Private RPC nodes**: RBAC-protected RPC endpoints
- **API portal**: Controlled access to network functionality
- **Data availability**: Private node set for data storage

## Security and trust

### Trust assumptions

Private Validium requires trust in:

- **Data availability providers**: Must make data available when needed
- **Validator set**: Must follow consensus protocol (QBFT provides fault tolerance)
- **Finalization layer**: Inherits security from Ethereum

### Security features

- **Minimum node count**: 4 nodes for QBFT fault tolerance
- **Access controls**: RBAC on RPC and API endpoints
- **Key management**: Web3Signer with KMS for signing operations
- **Network isolation**: Private network topology

## Data availability

### Node-based data availability

Initial deployments use a private node set for data storage. Participants must trust that data
availability providers will make data available when needed.

## Getting started

To deploy Private Validium:

1. Review [Deployment Models](/stack/how-it-works/deployment-models/options) to understand Private Validium
   characteristics.
2. Follow [Deploy Private Validium](/stack/guides/deployment-guides/deploy-private-validium) for
   step-by-step deployment.
3. Configure <!-- todo: does this need to be built out [Data availability](/stack/guides/configuration-guides/configure-data-availability) --> data availability
   and <!-- todo: does this need to be built out [RBAC](/stack/guides/configuration-guides/configure-rbac) --> RBAC.
4. Set up [Operational procedures](/stack/guides/operations-guides) for monitoring and maintenance.
