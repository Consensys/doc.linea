The Linea stack provides features and capabilities that enable various deployment models and use cases.
This section documents the features available in The Linea stack.

## Deployment model features

### Private Validium

Private Validium provides:

- Offchain data availability: Transaction data stored privately
- RBAC: Role-based access control for RPC and API endpoints
- Privacy: Transaction details not visible on finalization layer
- Compliance: KYC/KYT controls and selective data disclosure
- API portal: Controlled access to network functionality

For details on Private Validium, see [Private Validium](./validium.mdx).

### Hybrid

Hybrid deployments enable:

- Selective data availability: Choose onchain or offchain per transaction
- Flexible privacy: Mix public and private transactions
- Gradual migration: Transition from private to public

:::note

Hybrid deployment features are under development. Documentation will be updated as features mature.

:::

### Public

Public deployments provide:

- Onchain data availability: All data posted via EIP-4844 blobs
- Full transparency: All transactions visible on finalization layer
- Open access: No access controls required

:::note

Public deployment features are under development. Documentation will be updated as features mature.

## Core features

### Zero-knowledge proofs

The Linea stack uses zero-knowledge proofs to:

- Verify state transitions without revealing transaction details
- Provide cryptographic guarantees of correctness
- Enable efficient finalization on the finalization layer

For details on how proofs are generated and used in the transaction lifecycle, see [Transaction lifecycle](/protocol/transaction-lifecycle).

### EVM equivalence

Full EVM compatibility enables:

- Deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts without modification
- Use standard Ethereum tooling and libraries
- Maintain compatibility with Ethereum ecosystem

### Dual-layer architecture

Separation of consensus and execution provides:

- Client diversity and network resilience
- Modular deployment and scaling
- Operational flexibility

### QBFT consensus

QBFT consensus enables:

- Fault tolerance (3f+1 nodes)
- Fast finality
- Decentralized block production (with sufficient validators)
