Linea provides options to deploy networks that provide instant finality.

## What is instant finality?

Finality is the point at which a transaction becomes immutable and you can’t reverse or change it under the protocol’s security assumptions. Instant finality means a block becomes final before the next block is produced.

Layer 2 (L2) blockchains bundle and submit transactions to the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain. Soft finality is reached when a block is confirmed and committed to the L2. Hard finality is reached when the transaction is confirmed and committed to the L1. On Linea, sequencers confirm the state of the chain during block production, so soft finality is conisdered a final state, allowing for instant finality before reaching the L1.

## Standalone Linea Enterprise

As a Standalone or L2 blockchain, instant finality is guaranteed by Linea’s block production 
protocol both when running a single validator (sequencer) or when running multiple validators with 
Quorum-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT) consensus.

## L2 Linea Enterprise

As a L2 blockchain, zero knowledge validity proofs supplied by the prover provide instant 
L1 finality for the entire L2 state being committed, as soon as the block on which they are posted 
is finalized, without the need for challenge windows.

## Finality time as an operator decision

Soft finality is reached instantaneously at the block boundary. The [Public network](../../network/overview/index.mdx) operators set this block boundary to once every 2 seconds; however, operators may choose 1 second, or lower. 

When running a single validator, block production is not impacted by network conditions. When running a set of validators, congestion on the validator network may lead to accrued block validation time, however consensus always guarantees that a validated block is final.
