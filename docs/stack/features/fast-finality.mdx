Linea supports enterprises with options to deploy networks that provide instant finality.

## Standalone Linea Enterprise

As a Standalone or Layer 2 blockchain, instant finality is guaranteed by Linea’s block production 
protocol both when running a single validator (sequencer) or when running multiple validators with 
Quorum-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT) consensus.

## Layer 2 Linea Enterprise

As a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain, zero knowledge validity proofs supplied by the prover provide instant 
L1 finality for the entire L2 state being committed, as soon as the block on which they are posted 
is finalized, without the need for challenge windows.

## Finality time as a operator decision

Enterprise Linea L2 network soft finality is reached instantaneously at the block boundary. The [Public network](../../network/overview/index.mdx) operators set this block boundary to once every 2 seconds, however, operators may choose 1 second, or lower. 

When running a single validator, block production is not impacted by network conditions. When running a set of validators, congestion on the validator network may lead to accrued block validation time, however consensus always guarantees that a validated block is final.
