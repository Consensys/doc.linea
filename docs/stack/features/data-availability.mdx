The Linea protocol and operator stack offers certain data availability capabilities. Such capabilities are provided through both protocol guarantees and operator-controlled integrations.

Data availability is a correctness-critical requirement. For deployment design, see
[data availability and finalization](../how-it-works/data-availability-finalization.mdx).

## Define data availability capabilities

### Protocol support 

Linea enables:

- Native support for EIP-4844 blobs (public deployments with Ethereum finalization)
- State commitment posting to the finalization layer
- Deterministic state reconstruction given available data

### Deployment-provided implementations

Operators have full control over:

- Redundant data storage and backup strategies
- Recovery and reconstruction procedures

And for an enterprise private validium deployment, operators:

- Select data availability providers, or
- Manage data storage infrastructure

## Next steps

See more on [deployment models](../how-it-works/deployment-models.mdx).
