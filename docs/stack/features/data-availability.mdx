The Linea protocol and operator stack offers certain data availability capabilities. Such capabilities are provided through both protocol guarantees and operator-controlled integrations.

Data availability is a correctness-critical requirement. For deployment design, see
[data availability and finalization](../how-it-works/data-availability-finalization.mdx).

## Define data availability capabilities

### Protocol support (Linea)

- Native support for EIP-4844 blobs (Public deployments with Ethereum finalization)
- State commitment posting to the finalization layer
- Deterministic state reconstruction given available data

### Deployment-provided implementations (Operator)

- Redundant data storage and backup strategies
- Recovery and reconstruction procedures

### Private validium requirements

- Operator-selected data availability providers
- Operator-managed data storage infrastructure

## Next steps
