The Linea stack enables you to deploy and operate your own Linea network. Whether you need a private
Validium for regulated financial applications, a hybrid network with selective data availability, or
a public network, The Linea stack provides the components and configuration options to meet your
requirements.

## What is the Linea stack?

The Linea stack is the collection of software components, configuration options, and operational procedures
required to run a Linea network. It includes:

- **Consensus layer client:** ([Maru](/protocol/repos#maru)) Handles block production and consensus
  using QBFT
- **Execution layer clients:** ([Linea Besu](/protocol/repos#linea-besu-upstream), [Geth](/network/how-to/run-a-node/geth), [Erigon](/network/how-to/run-a-node/erigon)) Execute transactions and maintain state
- **[Sequencer](/protocol/sequencer)**: Orders and processes transactions into blocks
- **[Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator)**: Orchestrates batching, proof generation, and finalization
- **[Prover](/protocol/prover)**: Generates zero-knowledge proofs for state transitions

For details on how transactions flow through these components, see [Transaction lifecycle](/protocol/transaction-lifecycle).
- **[State Manager](/protocol/state-manager)**: Maintains L2 state and provides proof generation data
- **Bridge components:** ([Postman](/protocol/repos#linea-monorepo)) Enable cross-chain interoperability

For repository information, see [Linea repositories](/protocol/repos).

## Deployment models

The Linea stack supports three deployment models:

- **Private Validium**: Transaction data remains off-chain with private data availability. Ideal for
  regulated financial institutions requiring privacy and compliance controls.
- **Hybrid**: Combines public and private elements, allowing selective data availability based on
  transaction requirements.
- **Public**: Fully public network with on-chain data availability, similar to Linea Mainnet.

For details on each model, see [Deployment Models](/stack/how-it-works/deployment-models).

## What you need to know

To operate a Linea network, you need to understand:

- **Hardware and software requirements**: Resource needs for each component type
- **Component architecture**: How components interact and their responsibilities
- **Configuration choices**: Data availability, scaling strategies, and network topology
- **Operational procedures**: Deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and troubleshooting

## Getting started

1. Review [How It Works](/stack/how-it-works) to understand the architecture and deployment models.
2. Choose your deployment model based on your requirements.
3. Follow the [Deployment Guides](/stack/guides/deployment-guides) for step-by-step setup.
4. Configure your network using the [Configuration Guides](/stack/guides/configuration-guides).
5. Establish operational procedures using the [Operations Guides](/stack/guides/operations-guides).
