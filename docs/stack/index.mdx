The Linea stack provides a shared, extensible foundation for running your own Linea network.

:::info Configurable

The Linea stack supports operators who need more control than a Layer-1 network can offer, without sacrificing interoperability, security guarantees, or alignment with the EVM protocols. Whether you are deploying a private network for regulated environments, you favor selective data availability, or are operating a fully public network, the Linea stack gives you the components and operational model to do so.

:::

## Why the Linea stack exists

As blockchain adoption grows, many organizations encounter a common set of constraints:

- Layer 1 transactions can be expensive and slow
- Public networks do not offer sufficient privacy or control
- Bespoke infrastructure is costly to build and difficult to maintain
- Regulatory, governance, and operational requirements are hard to enforce on open systems
- Interoperability between private systems and public blockchains remains fragmented.

The Linea stack lets you run a Linea-compatible network tailored to
your requirements, using open source technology, while remaining anchored to the same protocol foundations 
as [Linea Mainnet](../network/overview/index.mdx).

## What the Linea stack provides

At a high level, the Linea stack provides:

- **Low-cost transactions:** 10× cheaper than Ethereum L1 costs.

- **Fast transactions:** Linea's 2s block times supports near-instant
  [soft finality](../network/overview/known-finality-state.mdx#step-3-state-tracking).

- **Trustless Ethereum interoperability:** Access Ethereum's deep liquidity via Linea's trustless 
rollup architecture.

- **An EVM-compatible execution environment:** Run an EVM-equivalent network that aligns with the 
Linea protocol and tooling ecosystem.

- **Flexible deployment models:** Deploy rollup networks with customizations to suit your privacy, 
compliance, and availability requirements.

- **Privacy and data availability controls:** Keep transaction data private as required, while still 
benefiting from trust-minimized finalization.

- **Operational clarity and control:** Clearly defined components, responsibilities, and failure 
boundaries so operators can reason about risk, uptime, and compliance.

- **Interoperability by design:** Enable controlled interaction with other networks and public 
blockchains through standardized bridge components.

## Who this is for

The Linea stack serves technical operators and infrastructure teams who:

- Need to run and operate their own Linea network
- Require privacy, governance, or regulatory controls not available on public networks
- Want production-capable infrastructure rather than experimental prototypes
- Are responsible for deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and incident response.

It assumes familiarity with distributed systems and blockchain infrastructure, but does not require
deep protocol expertise.
