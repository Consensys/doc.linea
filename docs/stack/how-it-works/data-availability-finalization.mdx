Understanding data availability and finalization is essential for deploying and operating a Linea
network. This page explains what operators need to know to make deployment decisions.

## Data availability

Data availability is the guarantee that transaction data is accessible when needed. Your deployment
model determines where and how data is stored.

### Private Validium

**Data availability:** Off-chain in a private node set

- Transaction data is stored off-chain in a private node set
- Only state commitments and proofs are posted to the finalization layer
- Participants must trust that data availability providers will make data available when needed
- No on-chain data posting (reduces costs but requires trust)

**Your responsibility:**

- Deploy and maintain private node set for data storage
- Ensure data redundancy and backup procedures

### Public

**Data availability:** On-chain via EIP-4844 blobs

- All transaction data is posted to the finalization layer using EIP-4844 blobs
- Data is available on-chain for verification and state recovery
- Blobs expire after 4,096 epochs (~18 days) but state commitments remain
- Maximum transparency and on-chain data availability guarantees

**Your responsibility:**

- Ensure coordinator can post blobs to finalization layer
- Monitor blob posting success and gas costs

### Hybrid

**Data availability:** Selective (on-chain or off-chain per transaction)

- Some transactions have on-chain data availability (EIP-4844 blobs)
- Other transactions remain off-chain (private node set)
- Choice of data availability per transaction

**Your responsibility:**

- Manage both on-chain and off-chain data availability
- Configure selective data availability logic

## Finalization layer

The finalization layer is the blockchain where your Linea network submits proofs and state
commitments for verification and hard finality.

### L2 vs. L3

Your network's layer designation depends on your finalization layer:

- **L2**: If your finalization layer is an L1 (e.g., Ethereum), your network is an L2
- **L3**: If your finalization layer is an L2 (e.g., Linea Mainnet), your network is an L3

**Example:**

- Private Linea instance finalizing to Linea Mainnet = L3 (L3 → L2 → L1)
- Private Linea instance finalizing to Ethereum = L2 (L2 → L1)
- Public Linea Mainnet finalizing to Ethereum = L2 (L2 → L1)

### Finalization layer options

**Ethereum L1:**

- Direct finalization on Ethereum
- Higher costs and longer finality times
- Maximum security guarantees
- Suitable for: High-value applications requiring maximum security

**Linea Mainnet L2:**

- Finalization on Linea Mainnet (which finalizes to Ethereum)
- Lower costs and faster finality times
- Inherits security from Ethereum (via Linea Mainnet)
- Suitable for: Applications that can accept L2 finalization layer

### Smart contract requirements

**You must deploy smart contracts on your finalization layer:**

1. **Rollup contract**: Stores rollup blocks, monitors state updates, and tracks deposits
2. **Verifier contract**: Verifies zero-knowledge proofs submitted by your coordinator

**How it works:**

1. [Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator) submits proofs and blob data to finalization layer
2. Rollup contract receives the submission
3. Rollup contract calls verifier contract to verify the proof
4. Verifier contract uses blob data to verify proof validity
5. If verification succeeds, state is finalized on the finalization layer

**Your responsibility:**

- Deploy rollup and verifier contracts on your chosen finalization layer
- Configure coordinator to connect to these contracts
- Monitor contract interactions and gas costs
- Manage contract upgrades and governance

:::important

Without the rollup and verifier contracts on your finalization layer, your coordinator cannot
finalize batches. These contracts are required for proof verification and state finalization.

## Data availability vs. finalization

**Data availability** and **finalization** are separate concerns:

- **Data availability**: Where transaction data is stored (on-chain vs. off-chain)
- **Finalization**: Where proofs and state commitments are verified (L1 vs. L2)

**Examples:**

- **Private Validium on Ethereum**: Off-chain data availability, L1 finalization (L2)
- **Private Validium on Linea Mainnet**: Off-chain data availability, L2 finalization (L3)
- **Public on Ethereum**: On-chain data availability, L1 finalization (L2)
- **Public on Linea Mainnet**: On-chain data availability, L2 finalization (L3)

## Operational implications

### For Private Validium

- **Data availability**: You must ensure private node set redundancy and backup
- **Finalization**: You must deploy contracts on your chosen finalization layer
- **Trust assumptions**: You trust data availability providers; finalization layer provides security

### For Public

- **Data availability**: Finalization layer provides on-chain data availability
- **Finalization**: You must deploy contracts on your chosen finalization layer
- **Trust assumptions**: Finalization layer provides both data availability and security

### Choosing a finalization layer

Consider:

- **Security requirements**: L1 finalization provides maximum security; L2 finalization is sufficient
  for many use cases
- **Cost**: L2 finalization is cheaper than L1
- **Finality time**: L2 finalization may be faster than L1
- **Contract deployment**: You must deploy contracts on your chosen finalization layer
