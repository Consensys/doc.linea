This section covers your options and responsibilities for data availability and finalization. Understanding [data availability and finalization](/protocol/architecture#data-availability-and-finalization) is essential for deploying and operating a Linea
network.

The following examples show different combinations of data availability and finalization:

- L2 Private Validium on Ethereum: Offchain data availability, L1 finalization
- L3 Private Validium on Linea Mainnet: Offchain data availability, L2 finalization
- L2 Public on Ethereum: Onchain data availability, L1 finalization
- L3 Public on Linea Mainnet: Onchain data availability, L2 finalization

## Data availability

Data Availability nodes (DAs) play a crucial role in preserving and providing access to transaction data required to reconstruct the state of the Linea Network. While zk-SNARK proofs ensure the correctness of state transitions, DAs guarantee that the transaction data underlying these proofs remains accessible to anyone who wants to verify or reconstruct the historical state.

Data availability is the guarantee that transaction data is accessible when needed. Your deployment
model determines where and how data is stored.

### Private Validium

In a Validium, data availability is typically provided by the Validium’s archive nodes rather than an external DA solution. As long as a subset of these nodes remain honest and online, the full transaction history can be reconstructed and independently verified. Because the chain is private, data is not posted to the finalization layer, but is instead retained within the Validium infrastructure under the operational and governance controls of the participating institutions. In this model, assurance of data availability is primarily based on institutional guarantees, node redundancy, and operational SLAs across the consortium of operators.

**Data availability:** Offchain in a private node set

- Transaction data is stored offchain in a private node set
- Only state commitments and proofs are posted to the finalization layer
- Participants must trust that data availability providers will make data available when needed
- No onchain data posting (reduces costs but requires trust)

**Your responsibility:**

- Deploy and maintain private node set for data storage
- Ensure data redundancy and backup procedures

### Public

**Data availability:** Onchain via EIP-4844 blobs

- All transaction data is posted to the finalization layer using EIP-4844 blobs
- Data is available onchain for verification and state recovery
- Blobs expire after 4,096 epochs (~18 days) but state commitments remain
- Maximum transparency and onchain data availability guarantees

**Your responsibility:**

- Ensure coordinator can post blobs to finalization layer
- Monitor blob posting success and gas costs

### Hybrid

**Data availability:** Selective (onchain or offchain per transaction)

- Some transactions have onchain data availability (EIP-4844 blobs)
- Other transactions remain offchain (private node set)
- Choice of data availability per transaction

**Your responsibility:**

- Manage both onchain and offchain data availability
- Configure selective data availability logic

## Finalization layer

The finalization layer is the blockchain where your Linea network submits proofs and state
commitments for verification and hard finality. It also determines the layer of your network:

- L2: If your finalization layer is an L1 (such as, Ethereum), your network is an L2
- L3: If your finalization layer is an L2 (such as, Linea Mainnet), your network is an L3.

**Examples:**

- Private Linea instance finalizing to Linea Mainnet = L3 (L3 → L2 → L1)
- Private Linea instance finalizing to Ethereum = L2 (L2 → L1)
- Public Linea Mainnet finalizing to Ethereum = L2 (L2 → L1)

### Finalization layer options

You have two options for your finalization layer.

**Ethereum L1:**

- Direct finalization on Ethereum
- Higher costs and longer finality times
- Maximum security guarantees
- Suitable for: High-value applications requiring maximum security

**Linea Mainnet L2:**

- Finalization on Linea Mainnet (which finalizes to Ethereum)
- Lower costs and faster finality times
- Inherits security from Ethereum (via Linea Mainnet)
- Suitable for: Applications that can accept L2 finalization layer

#### Operational implications

When choosing a finalization layer, consider the following:

- Security requirements: L1 finalization provides maximum security; L2 finalization is sufficient for many use cases.
- Cost: L2 finalization is cheaper than L1.
- Finality time: L2 finalization may be faster than L1.
- Contract deployment: You must deploy contracts on your chosen finalization layer.

### Smart contract requirements

Your finalization layer must deploy the following smart contracts:

1. Rollup contract: Stores rollup blocks, monitors state updates, and tracks deposits
2. Verifier contract: Verifies zero-knowledge proofs submitted by your coordinator

Together, these contracts allow your coordinator to finalize batches and state. The process is as follows:

1. The [coordinator](../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx) submits proofs and blob data to the finalization layer.
2. The rollup contract receives the submission.
3. The rollup contract calls the verifier contract to verify the proof.
4. The verifier contract uses blob data to verify proof validity.
5. If verification succeeds, state is finalized on the finalization layer.

:::important

Without the rollup and verifier contracts on your finalization layer, your coordinator cannot
finalize batches. These contracts are required for proof verification and state finalization.
