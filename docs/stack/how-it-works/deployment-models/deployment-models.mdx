The Linea stack supports three deployment models, each optimized for different use cases and
requirements. Your choice of deployment model affects data availability, network topology, access
controls, and operational procedures.

## Private Validium

Private Validium keeps transaction data off-chain while maintaining cryptographic guarantees through
zero-knowledge proofs. This model is ideal for regulated financial institutions requiring privacy,
compliance controls, and selective data disclosure.

### Characteristics

- **Data availability**: Transaction data stored off-chain in a private node set
- **Privacy**: Transaction details not visible on the finalization layer
- **Access control**: RPC endpoints protected by RBAC; only authorized participants can view data
- **Finalization**: State commitments and proofs posted to finalization layer (Ethereum or Linea
  Mainnet); see [Transaction lifecycle](/protocol/transaction-lifecycle) for details on the
  finalization process
- **Network topology**: Private network with controlled node membership

### Use cases

- Regulated financial applications requiring transaction privacy
- Institutions needing KYC/KYT compliance controls
- Applications requiring selective data disclosure to auditors and regulators
- Multi-party workflows where participants should not see all transaction details

### Components

Private Validium deployments include:

- Consensus layer ([Maru](/protocol/repos#maru)) with QBFT consensus (minimum 4 nodes)
- Execution layer ([Linea Besu](/protocol/repos#linea-besu-upstream) recommended)
- [Sequencer](/protocol/sequencer) with regulatory logic plugins
- [Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator) and [prover](/protocol/prover) for proof generation
- [State manager](/protocol/state-manager) for state tracking
- Private RPC nodes with RBAC
- API portal for controlled access

### Data availability

Data is stored in a private node set. Participants must trust that data availability providers will
make data available when needed. 

### Security considerations

- Minimum node count: 4 nodes for QBFT fault tolerance
- Access controls: RBAC on RPC endpoints and API portal
- Key management: Web3Signer with KMS for signing operations
- Network isolation: Private network topology with controlled peering

## Hybrid

Hybrid deployments combine public and private elements, allowing selective data availability based on
transaction requirements. Some transactions may have on-chain data availability while others remain
private.

### Characteristics

- **Selective data availability**: Choice of on-chain or off-chain data per transaction
- **Flexible privacy**: Public transactions visible on-chain; private transactions off-chain
- **Mixed access**: Public RPC for public transactions; private RPC with RBAC for private
  transactions
- **Finalization**: All state commitments posted to finalization layer regardless of data
  availability choice

### Use cases

- Applications needing both public and private transaction types
- Networks transitioning from private to public
- Use cases requiring flexibility in data availability strategy

:::note

Hybrid deployment model documentation is under development. Configuration and operational procedures
will be documented as the feature matures.

## Public

Public deployments are fully public networks with on-chain data availability, similar to Linea
Mainnet. All transaction data is posted to the finalization layer using EIP-4844 blobs.

### Characteristics

- **Data availability**: All transaction data posted on-chain via EIP-4844 blobs
- **Public access**: Open RPC endpoints; no access controls required
- **Transparency**: All transactions visible on the finalization layer
- **Finalization**: State commitments, proofs, and data posted to finalization layer

### Use cases

- Public networks requiring maximum transparency
- Applications benefiting from on-chain data availability guarantees
- Networks prioritizing decentralization over privacy

:::note

Public deployment model documentation is under development. Configuration and operational procedures
will be documented as the feature matures.

## Choosing a deployment model

Consider these factors when choosing a deployment model:

- **Privacy requirements**: Do you need transaction data to remain private?
- **Regulatory compliance**: Do you need KYC/KYT controls and selective disclosure?
- **Data availability guarantees**: How important are on-chain data availability guarantees?
- **Network topology**: Do you need a private network with controlled membership?
- **Access control**: Do you need RBAC on RPC endpoints and APIs?

For most enterprise and regulated financial use cases, Private Validium provides the necessary
privacy, compliance, and access control features.
