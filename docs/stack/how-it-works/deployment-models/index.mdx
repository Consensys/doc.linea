The Linea stack supports three deployment models, each optimized for different use cases and
requirements. Your choice of deployment model affects data availability, network topology, access
controls, and operational procedures.

## Private Validium

A private network instance, a [Validium](./private-validium.mdx) keeps transaction data offchain while maintaining cryptographic guarantees through
zero-knowledge proofs. This model is ideal for regulated financial institutions requiring privacy,
compliance controls, and selective data disclosure.

### Characteristics

- Data availability: Transaction data stored offchain in a private node set
- Privacy: Transaction details not visible on the finalization layer
- Access control: RPC endpoints protected by RBAC; only authorized participants can view data
- Finalization: State commitments and proofs posted to finalization layer (Ethereum or Linea
  Mainnet); see [Transaction lifecycle](/protocol/transaction-lifecycle) for details on the
  finalization process
- Network topology: Private network with controlled node membership

### Use cases

- Regulated financial applications requiring transaction privacy
- Institutions needing KYC/KYT compliance controls
- Applications requiring selective data disclosure to auditors and regulators
- Multi-party workflows where participants should not see all transaction details

### Data availability

Data is stored in a private node set. Participants must trust that data availability providers will
make data available when needed. 

### Security considerations

- Minimum node count: 4 nodes for QBFT fault tolerance
- Access controls: RBAC on RPC endpoints and API portal
- Key management: Web3Signer with KMS for signing operations
- Network isolation: Private network topology with controlled peering

## Hybrid

Hybrid deployments combine public and private elements, allowing selective data availability based on
transaction requirements. Some transactions may have onchain data availability while others remain
private.

### Characteristics

- Selective data availability: Choice of onchain or offchain data per transaction
- Flexible privacy: Public transactions visible onchain; private transactions offchain
- Mixed access: Public RPC for public transactions; private RPC with RBAC for private
  transactions
- Finalization: All state commitments posted to finalization layer regardless of data
  availability choice

### Use cases

- Applications needing both public and private transaction types
- Networks transitioning from private to public
- Use cases requiring flexibility in data availability strategy

:::note

Hybrid deployment model documentation is under development. Configuration and operational procedures
will be documented as the feature matures.

## Public

Public deployments are fully public networks with onchain data availability, similar to Linea
Mainnet. All transaction data is posted to the finalization layer using EIP-4844 blobs.

### Characteristics

- Data availability: All transaction data posted onchain via EIP-4844 blobs
- Public access: Open RPC endpoints; no access controls required
- Transparency: All transactions visible on the finalization layer
- Finalization: State commitments, proofs, and data posted to finalization layer

### Use cases

- Public networks requiring maximum transparency
- Applications benefiting from onchain data availability guarantees
- Networks prioritizing decentralization over privacy

:::note

Public deployment model documentation is under development. Configuration and operational procedures
will be documented as the feature matures.

## Choosing a deployment model

Consider these factors when choosing a deployment model:

- Privacy requirements: Do you need transaction data to remain private?
- Regulatory compliance: Do you need KYC/KYT controls and selective disclosure?
- Data availability guarantees: How important are onchain data availability guarantees?
- Network topology: Do you need a private network with controlled membership?
- Access control: Do you need RBAC on RPC endpoints and APIs?

For most enterprise and regulated financial use cases, a [private Validium](./private-validium.mdx) provides the necessary
privacy, compliance, and access control features.
