This section introduces how the Linea stack works, from an operator's perspective. It covers the
architecture, deployment models, and component boundaries you need to understand to run a network
effectively. 

## Architecture

As an EVM-compatible network, the Linea stack uses a dual-layer architecture separating consensus from execution. This design enables modular deployment, client diversity, and operational flexibility.

For details on the technical stack, see the [architectural overview](./architecture.mdx).

## Data availability and finalization

Understanding data availability and finalization is essential for deployment decisions. For details on
L2/L3 relationships, smart contract requirements, and how data availability differs by deployment
model, see [data availability and finalization](./data-availability-finalization.mdx)..

## Deployment models

The Linea stack supports three deployment models, each with different characteristics:

- Private Validium: Offchain data availability, ideal for regulated financial applications
- Hybrid: Selective data availability combining public and private elements
- Public: Fully public network with onchain data availability

For more details on the three deployment options, see [deployment models](./deployment-models/index.mdx).

## Boundaries and responsibilities

Understanding component boundaries helps you:

- Plan deployment and scaling strategies
- Identify failure modes and recovery procedures
- Make informed configuration decisions
- Troubleshoot operational issues

For details on component responsibilities and failure modes, see [boundaries and responsibilities](./boundaries-responsibilities.mdx).
