This section explains how The Linea stack operates from an operator's perspective. It covers the
architecture, deployment models, and component boundaries you need to understand to run a network
effectively. For details on how transactions flow through the system, see [Transaction lifecycle](/protocol/transaction-lifecycle).

## What you'll learn

- **Architecture**: How components interact and their roles in the network
- **Data availability and finalization**: Understanding L2/L3 relationships and smart contract
  requirements
- **Deployment Models**: Differences between Private Validium, Hybrid, and Public deployments
- **Boundaries & Responsibilities**: What each component is responsible for and failure modes

## Architecture

The Linea stack uses a dual-layer architecture separating consensus (Maru) from execution (Besu/Geth).
This design enables modular deployment, client diversity, and operational flexibility.

## Data availability and finalization

Understanding data availability and finalization is essential for deployment decisions. Learn about
L2/L3 relationships, smart contract requirements, and how data availability differs by deployment
model.

## Deployment models

The Linea stack supports three deployment models, each with different characteristics:

- **Private Validium**: Off-chain data availability, ideal for regulated financial applications
- **Hybrid**: Selective data availability combining public and private elements
- **Public**: Fully public network with on-chain data availability

## Boundaries & responsibilities

Understanding component boundaries helps you:

- Plan deployment and scaling strategies
- Identify failure modes and recovery procedures
- Make informed configuration decisions
- Troubleshoot operational issues
