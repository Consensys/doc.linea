This section introduces how the Linea stack works from an operator's perspective. It surfaces the
architecture, deployment models, and component boundaries you need to understand to run a network
effectively. 

## Architecture

As an EVM-compatible network, the Linea stack uses a dual-layer architecture separating consensus from execution. This design enables modular deployment, client diversity, and operational flexibility. 

See more on the [protocol's architecture](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx).

## Deployment models

The Linea stack allows operators to tweak the deployment model according to their business case, for example, Linea can be operated as:

- Private Validium: Offchain data availability, ideal for regulated financial applications
- Public: Fully public network with onchain data availability

See more on the [deployment options](deployment-models.mdx).

## Data availability and finalization

For details on
L2/L3 relationships, smart contract requirements, and how data availability differs by deployment
model, see [data availability and finalization](./data-availability-finalization.mdx).

Understanding data availability and finalization is key to good deployment decisions.

## Boundaries and responsibilities

Understand component boundaries to:

- Plan deployment and scaling strategies
- Identify failure modes and recovery procedures
- Make informed configuration decisions
- Troubleshoot operational issues

See more on [boundaries and responsibilities](./boundaries-responsibilities.mdx).
