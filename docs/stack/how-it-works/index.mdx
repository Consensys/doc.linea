This section explains how the Linea stack operates from an operator's perspective. It covers the
architecture, deployment models, and component boundaries you need to understand to run a network
effectively. 

## Architecture

As an EVM-compatible protocol, the Linea stack uses a dual-layer architecture separating consensus (Maru) from execution (Besu/Geth). This design enables modular deployment, client diversity, and operational flexibility.

## Data availability and finalization

Understanding data availability and finalization is essential for deployment decisions. Learn about
L2/L3 relationships, smart contract requirements, and how data availability differs by deployment
model.

## Deployment models

The Linea stack supports three deployment models, each with different characteristics:

- **Private Validium**: Offchain data availability, ideal for regulated financial applications
- **Hybrid**: Selective data availability combining public and private elements
- **Public**: Fully public network with onchain data availability

## Boundaries & responsibilities

Understanding component boundaries helps you:

- Plan deployment and scaling strategies
- Identify failure modes and recovery procedures
- Make informed configuration decisions
- Troubleshoot operational issues

## Next steps

- For details on how transactions flow through the system, see the Public Mainnet [transaction lifecycle](/protocol/transaction-lifecycle).
- Consider getting started by deploying a [minimal viable network](../guides/run-your-own-network/index.mdx).
