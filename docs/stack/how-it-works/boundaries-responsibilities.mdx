Understanding boundaries and responsibilities is essential for safe network operation and trust
decisions. This documentation clarifies who operates what, what Linea provides vs. what you provide,
and how to handle failure scenarios.

## Who operates what

- Operational procedures and runbooks

## Failure scenarios

### Data availability provider failure

**Scenario:** Data availability providers fail or become unavailable (Private Validium).

**Impact:**

- Inability to recover state if nodes fail
- Compliance violations if data cannot be recovered
- Potential data loss

**Mitigation:**

- Deploy multiple data availability nodes with redundancy
- Implement regular backups of state and data
- Test data recovery procedures

**Your responsibility:** Ensure data availability through redundancy and backups.

### Sequencer failure

**Scenario:** [Sequencer](/protocol/sequencer) fails or becomes unavailable.

**Impact:**

- No new blocks are produced
- Transactions accumulate in mempool
- [Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator) cannot create new batches
- Network continues to serve queries but cannot process new transactions

**Mitigation:**

- Implement high availability for sequencer (active-passive setup)
- Monitor sequencer health and transaction throughput
- Have recovery procedures ready

**Your responsibility:** Ensure sequencer availability and recovery procedures.

### Bridge failure

**Scenario:** Bridge components ([Postman](/protocol/repos#linea-monorepo)) fail or become unavailable.

**Impact:**

- Cross-chain message execution blocked
- Bridge transactions cannot be processed
- User funds may be locked

**Mitigation:**

- Deploy redundant bridge components
- Monitor bridge health and message processing
- Have recovery procedures ready

**Your responsibility:** Ensure bridge availability and recovery procedures.

### Upgrade failure

**Scenario:** Component upgrade fails or introduces breaking changes.

**Impact:**

- Network downtime
- Consensus failures
- Data corruption
- Inability to rollback

**Mitigation:**

- Test upgrades in non-production environments first
- Review release notes and breaking changes
- Plan maintenance windows
- Coordinate upgrades for consensus-critical components
- Have rollback procedures ready

**Your responsibility:** Test upgrades and have rollback procedures.

### Consensus layer failure

**Scenario:** Consensus layer ([Maru](/protocol/repos#maru)) fails or network partition occurs.

**Impact:**

- Block production stops
- All downstream processes stop
- Network cannot produce new blocks until recovery

**Mitigation:**

- Deploy minimum 4 nodes for QBFT fault tolerance
- Monitor consensus health
- Ensure network connectivity between nodes
- Have recovery procedures ready

**Your responsibility:** Ensure consensus layer redundancy and recovery procedures.

### Prover failure

**Scenario:** All [prover](/protocol/prover) instances fail.

**Impact:**

- Proofs cannot be generated
- [Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator) cannot submit to finalization layer
- Finalization is blocked
- Network continues to produce blocks but cannot finalize

**Mitigation:**

- Deploy multiple prover instances for redundancy
- Monitor prover health and proof generation latency
- Have recovery procedures ready

**Your responsibility:** Ensure prover redundancy and recovery procedures.
