Understanding boundaries and responsibilities is essential for safe network operation and trust
decisions. This documentation clarifies who operates what, what Linea provides vs. what you provide,
and how to handle failure scenarios.

## Operations

Generally speaking, Linea provides the underlying software components and protocols, while you are responsible for top-level network operations and access controls.

**Linea provides the following components and protocols:**

- Consensus layer client: [Maru](../../protocol/repos.mdx#maru), the QBFT consensus implementation
- Execution layer clients: [Linea Besu](../../protocol/repos.mdx#linea-besu-upstream), with support for Geth and Erigon
- [Sequencer](../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/index.mdx): Transaction ordering and block building
- [Coordinator](../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx): Proof generation orchestration
- [Prover](../../protocol/architecture/prover/index.mdx): Zero-knowledge proof generation
- [State manager](../../protocol/architecture/state-manager.mdx): State representation for proof generation
- Protocol specifications: Transaction lifecycle, finalization, and security guarantees

**You provide the following:**

- Infrastructure: Hardware, networking, and cloud resources
- Deployment: Installing, configuring, and deploying components
- Node operations: Running consensus and execution layer nodes.
- Monitoring and alerting: Observing component health and performance.
- Backup and disaster recovery: State backups and recovery procedures.
- Key management: Secure key storage and rotation.

If using the Private Validium deployment model, you also provide:

- Data availability: Ensuring data is available when needed 
- Access controls: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), API portal, and network security
- Compliance: Meeting regulatory requirements.

- State snapshot creation and restoration
- Serving `linea_getProof` RPC endpoints

**Boundaries:**

- Does not execute transactions (receives state updates from execution layer)
- Does not participate in consensus
- Does not generate proofs (provides data to prover)


## Security

Security is a shared responsibility. Linea provides cryptographic guarantees and consensus protocol security, while you provide infrastructure security, access control security, key management security, and operational security.

**Linea provides:**

- Cryptographic guarantees through zero-knowledge proofs
- Consensus protocol security (QBFT fault tolerance)
- Finalization layer security (inherited from the finalization layer, such as Ethereum)

**You provide:**

- Infrastructure security (network isolation, firewalls)
- Access control security (RBAC, API portal)
- Key management security (KMS, secure storage)
- Operational security (monitoring, incident response)

## Data availability

Linea provides a protocol for data availability, while you provide the data storage infrastructure, redundancy, and backup.

**Linea provides:**

- Protocol for data availability (EIP-4844 blobs for Public)
- State commitment posting to finalization layer

**You provide:**

- Data storage infrastructure (Private Validium)
- Data redundancy and backup

## Failure scenarios

The following is a list of failure scenarios and their mitigation plans.

### Data availability provider failure

**Scenario:** Data availability providers fail or become unavailable (Private Validium).

- Compliance violations if data cannot be recovered
- Potential data loss

**Mitigation:**

- Deploy multiple data availability nodes with redundancy
- Implement regular backups of state and data
- Test data recovery procedures

**Your responsibility:** Ensure data availability through redundancy and backups.

### Sequencer failure

**Scenario:** [Sequencer](../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/index.mdx) fails or becomes unavailable.

**Impact:**

- No new blocks are produced
- Transactions accumulate in mempool
- [Coordinator](../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx) cannot create new batches
- Network continues to serve queries but cannot process new transactions

**Mitigation:**

- Monitor sequencer health and transaction throughput
- Have recovery procedures ready

**Your responsibility:** Ensure sequencer availability and recovery procedures.

### Bridge failure

- User funds may be locked

**Mitigation:**

- Have recovery procedures ready

**Your responsibility:** Ensure bridge availability and recovery procedures.

### Upgrade failure

**Scenario:** Component upgrade fails or introduces breaking changes.

- Consensus failures
- Data corruption
- Inability to rollback

**Mitigation:**

- Test upgrades in non-production environments first
- Review release notes and breaking changes
- Plan maintenance windows
- Coordinate upgrades for consensus-critical components

**Your responsibility:** Test upgrades and have rollback procedures.

### Consensus layer failure

**Scenario:** Consensus layer ([Maru](../../protocol/repos.mdx#maru)) fails or network partition occurs.
