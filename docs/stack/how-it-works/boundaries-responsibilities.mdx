This page defines operational boundaries, responsibilities, and failure ownership
across the Linea stack. It assumes familiarity with the Linea [protocol architecture](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx) and focuses on responsibility allocation, not internal implementation details.

:::important

This page details the boundaries and responsibilities for enterprise clients who wish to run their own infrastructure either on premise or in their own cloud.

Reach out to [support.linea.build](https://support.linea.build/) to enquire about rollup-as-a-service, wherein all the following operations are handled.

:::

## Operational responsibility model

### Linea provides

- Open source protocol software and specifications
- Cryptographic correctness via zero-knowledge proofs
- Finalization mechanics and state commitments
- Canonical protocol behavior and invariants
- [Maru](../../protocol/architecture#consensus-client-maru) provides consensus protocol design leveraging Quorum-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT)

### Operators provide

**Everything required to run the protocol safely**

- Infrastructure (hardware, networking, cloud resources)
- Deployment and configuration of components
- Day-to-day operations
- Monitoring, alerting, and incident response
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Key management and signing security

**Additional responsibilities for Private Validium deployments**

- Data availability infrastructure
- Access controls (RBAC, API portal, network security)
- Optional: Compliance, governance, and audit processes

## Failure scenarios and ownership

The following failures are **operator-owned risks** with recommended mitigations.

### Data availability provider failure (Private Validium)

**Impact**

- State reconstruction impossible
- Compliance risk
- Potential permanent data loss

**Mitigation**

- Redundant data availability nodes
- Regular backups
- Tested recovery procedures

**Responsibility:** Operator or their partner data availability providers. 

### Sequencer failure

**Impact**

- No new blocks
- Transaction backlog
- Proof pipeline stalls

**Mitigation**

- High-availability sequencer setups
- Monitoring and alerting
- Recovery runbooks

**Responsibility:** Operator

#### Disaster recovery

See the [state recovery guide](../../network/how-to/recover-state.mdx).
