Understanding boundaries and responsibilities is essential for safe network operation and informed
trust decisions. This page clarifies who operates what, what Linea provides vs. what Operator provides,
and how responsibility is allocated when failures occur.

This documentation assumes familiarity with the Linea protocol architecture and focuses on
operational boundaries, not component behavior.

## Define operations

Linea provides the open source protocol software, specifications, and cryptographic guarantees.
Operators are responsible for deploying, operating, and securing the infrastructure that runs the
protocol.

### Linea provides

- Protocol software and specifications
- Cryptographic correctness guarantees via zero-knowledge proofs
- Consensus protocol design (QBFT)
- Finalization mechanics and state commitments
- Canonical protocol behavior and invariants

### Operators provide

- Infrastructure (hardware, networking, cloud resources)
- Deployment and configuration of components
- Day-to-day node operations
- Monitoring, alerting, and incident response
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Key management and signing security

For Private Validium deployments, operators also provide:

- Data availability infrastructure
- Access controls (RBAC, API portal, network security)
- Compliance and governance processes

## Define Linea component boundaries

The following sections describe what each component explicitly does not do, and where
responsibility shifts to other components or to the operator.

### Consensus layer ([Maru](../../protocol/repos.mdx#maru))

**Boundaries:**

- Does not execute transactions or maintain EVM state
- Does not generate zk-SNARK proofs
- Does not submit data or proofs to the finalization layer
- Communicates with execution layer only via the Engine API

### Execution layer ([Linea Besu](../../protocol/repos.mdx#linea-besu-upstream), Geth, Erigon)

**Boundaries:**

- Does not participate in consensus (handled by Maru)
- Does not generate proofs or interact with the coordinator
- Does not submit data or proofs to the finalization layer

For transaction execution flow, see the
[transaction lifecycle](../../protocol/transaction-lifecycle.mdx).

### [Sequencer](../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/index.mdx)

**Boundaries:**

- Does not participate in consensus (handled by Maru)
- Does not generate proofs or manage finalization
- Is not directly accessible from outside the network

For sequencing in the transaction flow, see the
[transaction lifecycle](../../protocol/transaction-lifecycle.mdx).

### [Coordinator](../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx)

**Boundaries:**

- Does not execute transactions or maintain state
- Does not generate proofs (delegated to prover)
- Does not participate in consensus

### [Prover](../../protocol/architecture/prover/index.mdx)

**Boundaries:**

- Does not execute transactions
- Does not create batches or blobs
- Does not submit proofs to the finalization layer

### [State manager](../../protocol/architecture/state-manager.mdx)

**Boundaries:**

- Does not execute transactions (receives state updates from execution layer)
- Does not participate in consensus
- Does not generate proofs (provides data to prover)

## Define security

Security is a shared responsibility between the Linea protocol and network operators.

### Linea provides

- Cryptographic correctness guarantees via zk-SNARKs
- Consensus protocol security: Quorum-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT)
- Finalization layer security (inherited from the finalization layer)
- Protocol-level security invariants

### Operator provides

- Infrastructure security (network isolation, firewalls)
- Access control security (RBAC, API portal)
- Key management security (KMS, secure storage)
- Operational security (monitoring, incident response)

## Define data availability

Linea defines protocol-level data availability mechanisms. Operators are responsible for ensuring
that data remains accessible according to the chosen deployment model.

### Linea provides

- Data availability protocol support (EIP-4844 blobs for Public deployments)
- State commitment posting to the finalization layer

### Operator provides

- Data storage infrastructure (Private Validium)
- Data redundancy and backup
- Data recovery procedures
- Trust in data availability providers (Private Validium)

## Define compliance and audit considerations

### Audit trails

**Linea provides:**

- Protocol-level transaction logs
- State commitment proofs
- Finalization records on the finalization layer

**Operator provides:**

- Comprehensive operational logging
- Access logs for RPC endpoints and APIs
- Audit trail retention and management

### Compliance controls

**Linea provides:**

- Protocol support for privacy (Private Validium)
- Selective data disclosure mechanisms (Private Validium)

**Operator provides:**

- KYC/KYT implementation (Private Validium)
- Access control enforcement (RBAC, API portal)
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Regulatory reporting procedures

### Data retention

**Linea provides:**

- State commitment retention on the finalization layer
- Protocol-level data retention rules

**Operator provides:**

- Data retention policies
- Archive node deployment
- Data deletion procedures (if required)

### Selective disclosure

**Linea provides:**

- Protocol-level selective disclosure support (Private Validium)

**Operator provides:**

- Disclosure implementation
- Auditor and regulator access controls
- Disclosure audit trails

## Define failure scenarios

The following scenarios outline operator-owned risks and mitigation strategies.

### Data availability provider failure (Private Validium)

**Impact:**

- Inability to reconstruct historical state
- Potential compliance violations
- Risk of permanent data loss

**Mitigation:**

- Redundant data availability nodes
- Regular backups
- Tested recovery procedures

**Your responsibility:** Ensure redundancy and recoverability.

### Sequencer failure

**Impact:**

- No new blocks produced
- Transactions accumulate
- Batching and proof generation stall

**Mitigation:**

- High-availability sequencer setups
- Health monitoring and alerting
- Recovery runbooks

**Your responsibility:** Maintain sequencer availability.

### Bridge failure

**Impact:**

- Cross-chain messages blocked
- Bridge transactions fail
- Potential fund lockup

**Mitigation:**

- Redundant bridge components, including
  [Postman](../../protocol/repos.mdx#linea-monorepo)
- Monitoring and recovery procedures

**Your responsibility:** Ensure bridge reliability.

### Upgrade failure

**Impact:**

- Network downtime
- Consensus instability
- Data corruption risk

**Mitigation:**

- Pre-production testing
- Coordinated upgrades
- Rollback plans

**Your responsibility:** Test and manage upgrades.

### Consensus layer failure

**Impact:**

- Block production halts
- All downstream processes stop

**Mitigation:**

- Minimum 4-node QBFT deployment
- Network health monitoring

**Your responsibility:** Ensure consensus redundancy.

### Prover failure

**Impact:**

- Proof generation blocked
- Finalization stalls

**Mitigation:**

- Multiple prover instances
- Performance and health monitoring

**Your responsibility:** Maintain prover redundancy.
