This page defines operational boundaries, responsibilities, and failure ownership
across the Linea stack. It assumes familiarity with the Linea [protocol architecture](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx) and focuses on responsibility allocation, not internal implementation details.

:::important

This page details the boundaries and responsibilities for enterprise clients who wish to run their own infrastructure either on premise or in their own cloud.

Reach out to [support.linea.build](https://support.linea.build/) to enquire about rollup-as-a-service, wherein all the following operations are handled.

:::

## Operational responsibility model

### Linea provides

- Open source protocol software and specifications
- Cryptographic correctness via zero-knowledge proofs
- Finalization mechanics and state commitments
- Canonical protocol behavior and invariants
- [Maru](../../protocol/architecture#consensus-client-maru) provides consensus protocol design leveraging Quorum-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT)

### Operators provide

**Everything required to run the protocol safely**

- Infrastructure (hardware, networking, cloud resources)
- Deployment and configuration of components
- Day-to-day operations
- Monitoring, alerting, and incident response
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Key management and signing security

**Additional responsibilities for Private Validium deployments**

- Data availability infrastructure
- Access controls (RBAC, API portal, network security)
- Optional: Compliance, governance, and audit processes

## Security responsibilities

Security is explicitly shared between the Linea protocol and network operators.

### Linea provides

- Cryptographic correctness guarantees via zk-SNARKs
- Consensus security via QBFT
- Finalization layer security (inherited)
- Protocol-level security invariants

### Operator provides

- Infrastructure security (network isolation, firewalls)
- Access control security (RBAC, API portal)
- Key management (KMS, secure storage) integration with Web3Signer
- Operational security (monitoring, incident response)

## Data availability responsibilities

### Linea provides

- Protocol-level data availability mechanisms
  - EIP-4844 blobs (Public deployments)
- State commitment posting to the finalization layer

### Operator provides

- Redundancy and backups
- Recovery procedures

#### Private Validium

- Trust in data availability providers
- Data storage infrastructure

## Compliance and audit responsibilities

### Audit trails

**Linea**

- Protocol-level transaction logs
- State commitment proofs
- Finalization records

**Operator**

- Operational logs
- RPC and API access logs
- Log retention and management

### Compliance controls

**Linea**

- Protocol support for privacy (Private Validium)
- Selective disclosure primitives

**Operator**

- KYC/KYT implementation
- Access enforcement (RBAC, API portal)
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Regulatory reporting processes

### Data retention and selective disclosure

**Linea**

- State commitment retention rules
- Protocol-level selective disclosure support (Private Validium)

**Operator**

- Retention policies
- Archive nodes
- Data deletion (if required)
- Auditor and regulator access controls
- Disclosure audit trails

## Failure scenarios and ownership

The following failures are **operator-owned risks** with recommended mitigations.

### Data availability provider failure (Private Validium)

**Impact**

- State reconstruction impossible
- Compliance risk
- Potential permanent data loss

**Mitigation**

- Redundant data availability nodes
- Regular backups
- Tested recovery procedures

**Responsibility:** Operator

### Sequencer failure

**Impact**

- No new blocks
- Transaction backlog
- Proof pipeline stalls

**Mitigation**

- High-availability sequencer setups
- Monitoring and alerting
- Recovery runbooks

**Responsibility:** Operator

See the [state recovery guide](../guides/state-recovery) for a walkthrough on recovering state from the finalization layer.

### Bridge failure

**Impact**

- Cross-chain messaging blocked
- Bridge transactions fail
- Potential fund lockup

**Mitigation**

- Redundant bridge components, including Postman
- Monitoring and recovery procedures

**Responsibility:** Operator

### Upgrade failure

**Impact**

- Network downtime
- Consensus instability
- Data corruption risk

**Mitigation**

- Pre-production testing
- Coordinated upgrades
- Rollback plans

**Responsibility:** Operator

### Consensus layer failure

**Impact**

- Block production halts
- All downstream systems stall

**Mitigation**

- Minimum 4-node QBFT deployment
- Network health monitoring

**Responsibility:** Operator

### Prover failure

**Impact**

- Proof generation blocked
- Finalization stalls

**Mitigation**

- Multiple prover instances
- Performance and health monitoring

**Responsibility:** Operator
