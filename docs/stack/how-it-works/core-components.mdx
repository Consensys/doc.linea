This page defines the **Linea protocol surface**, use this page as the canonical reference for:

- What must be operated as part of the protocol
- What must be trusted for protocol correctness
- How protocol-critical elements are versioned and replaced

## Core protocol components

The following components are **required for protocol correctness**, and **not optional**.

**Replaceability:** Versioned via protocol upgrade.

- [Maru](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx#consensus-client-maru): Consensus layer client
- [Linea Besu](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx#execution-client-linea-besu): Execution layer client
- [Sequencer](../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/index.mdx): Orders transactions and builds blocks
- [Coordinator](../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx): Orchestrates batching, proof generation, and submissions
- [Prover](../../protocol/architecture/prover/index.mdx): Generates zero-knowledge proofs of state transitions
- [State manager](../../protocol/architecture/state-manager.mdx): Maintains a state representation for proof generation
- [Tracer](../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/traces-generator.mdx): Generates execution traces required for proofs

## Onchain system contracts

The following [smart contracts](../../protocol/architecture/smart-contracts.mdx) are **required for correctness**, and **not optional**.

**Replaceability:** Versioned via redeployment.

- Finalization verifier
- Token bridge contracts
- Message bridge contracts
- Canonical token bridge

## Data availability

In addition to concrete components, the Linea protocol depends on correctness-critical requirements, which may be satisfied by different implementations depending on the [deployment model](./deployment-models.mdx).

**Purpose**

- Ensure transaction data and state transitions remain accessible
- Enable reconstruction and verification of historical state

**Correctness requirement**

- Without data availability, the protocol cannot be independently verified
- Loss of data availability breaks state reconstructability

**Example implementations**

- **Linea Public Mainnet deployment:** EIP-4844 blobs on Ethereum
- **Private Validium deployments:** Operator-provided or outsourced data availability infrastructure

**Trust model**

- Data availability is within the trust boundary
- Responsibility for data availability implementation depends on deployment model

See more on [data availability considerations](./data-availability-finalization.mdx).

## Auxiliary services

Auxiliary services are **not required for protocol correctness**. They are typically **optional** 
and **replaceable**.

Common examples include:

- [Block explorer](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx#block-explorer)
- [Archive node service](../../protocol/architecture/rpc-services.mdx#archive-nodes)
- [RPC load balancers](../../protocol/architecture/rpc-services.mdx#what-do-they-do)
- Monitoring and metrics
- Indexer
- API portal

**Special cases**

- [Web3Signer](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx#web3signer): remote signing with integration with a large number of Key Management Solutions (KMS):
  - Not required for correctness
  - *In* trust boundary (signing path)
  - Not replaceable: currently, Web3Signer is integral
  - Optional
