:::info

This guide is under development. Data availability configuration will be documented here.

:::

For Private Validium deployments, data availability is configured offchain using a private node
set. Configuration includes:

- Private node set setup
- Data storage and redundancy
- Backup procedures

For information about data availability strategies, see [Deployment Models](/stack/how-it-works/deployment-models/options).
