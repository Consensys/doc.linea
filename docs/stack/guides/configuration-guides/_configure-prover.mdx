:::info

This guide is under development. Prover configuration will be documented here.

:::

Prover configuration controls proof generation behavior and resource allocation. Configuration
includes:

- Proof generation settings
- File system paths for proof requests and responses
- Resource allocation (CPU, memory)
- Multiple prover instance coordination

For information about the prover's role, see [Prover](/protocol/prover).
