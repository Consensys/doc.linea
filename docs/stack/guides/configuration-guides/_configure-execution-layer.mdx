:::info

This guide is under development. Execution layer configuration options will be documented here.

:::

Execution layer configuration depends on the client you choose (Linea Besu, Geth, or Erigon). Common
configuration areas include:

- Engine API settings for Maru communication
- RPC endpoint configuration
- P2P networking
- Storage and sync mode
- Profiles (for Linea Besu)

For basic deployment configuration, see [Deploy execution layer](/stack/guides/deployment-guides/deploy-execution-layer).
