:::info

This guide is under development. Scaling strategies will be documented here.

:::

Scaling strategies help you handle increased load and improve performance. Approaches include:

- Horizontal scaling: Adding more node instances
- Vertical scaling: Increasing resources per node
- Prover scaling: Distributing proof generation across multiple instances
- RPC node scaling: Load balancing and redundancy
