This page documents common mistakes operators make when deploying and operating Linea networks. Learn
from these mistakes to avoid outages and security issues.

## Misconfigured data availability

### Mistake

Deploying Private Validium without proper data availability redundancy or backup procedures.

### Impact

- Data loss if data availability providers fail
- Inability to recover state if nodes fail
- Compliance violations if data cannot be recovered

### How to avoid

- Deploy multiple data availability nodes with redundancy
- Implement regular backups of state and data
- Test data recovery procedures
- Consider EigenDA integration for enhanced guarantees
- Document data availability procedures

## Incorrect trust assumptions

### Mistake

Assuming components provide guarantees they don't, or misunderstanding trust boundaries.

### Impact

- Security vulnerabilities
- Compliance violations
- Operational failures

### Common trust assumption mistakes

- Assuming data availability without redundancy: Private Validium requires trust in data availability providers
- Assuming single component provides all guarantees: Understanding component boundaries is critical
- Misunderstanding finalization guarantees: Soft finality vs. hard finality
- Assuming consensus provides data availability: Consensus and data availability are separate concerns

### How to avoid

- Review [boundaries and responsibilities](../../how-it-works/boundaries-responsibilities.mdx) carefully
- Understand trust assumptions for your deployment model
- Document your trust assumptions explicitly
- Test failure scenarios to validate assumptions

## Skipped monitoring

### Mistake

Deploying to production without comprehensive monitoring and alerting.

### Impact

- Delayed detection of failures
- Extended downtime
- Data loss or corruption
- Compliance violations

### How to avoid

- Set up monitoring before production deployment
- Monitor all components, not just some
- Set up alerts for critical failures
- Create dashboards for network health
- Test alerting to ensure it works

## Unsafe upgrades

### Mistake

Upgrading components without proper testing, rollback procedures, or coordination.

### Impact

- Network downtime
- Consensus failures
- Data corruption
- Inability to rollback

### How to avoid

- Test upgrades in non-production environments first
- Review release notes and breaking changes
- Plan maintenance windows
- Coordinate upgrades for consensus-critical components
- Have rollback procedures ready
- Test rollback procedures

## Insufficient node count

### Mistake

Deploying fewer than 4 nodes for QBFT consensus.

### Impact

- No fault tolerance (network cannot tolerate any node failures)
- Consensus failures if any node fails
- Network instability

### How to avoid

- Deploy minimum 4 nodes for QBFT consensus
- Understand fault tolerance requirements (3f+1)
- Plan for node failures in your deployment

## Missing access controls

### Mistake

Deploying Private Validium without RBAC or API portal access controls.

### Impact

- Unauthorized access to network
- Compliance violations
- Security vulnerabilities

### How to avoid

- Configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) before production deployment
- Set up API portal for controlled access
- Test access controls
- Review access control configuration regularly

## Inadequate key management

### Mistake

Using insecure key storage or not having key rotation procedures.

### Impact

- Key compromise
- Network security breach
- Inability to rotate compromised keys

### How to avoid

- Use [remote signing](../../how-it-works/architecture.mdx#web3signer) backed by a hardware security module (HSM) or key management
service (KMS)
- Implement key rotation procedures
- Secure backup of keys
- Never store keys in plain text

## Missing disaster recovery procedures

### Mistake

Deploying without tested backup and disaster recovery procedures.

### Impact

- Extended downtime after failures
- Data loss
- Inability to recover from disasters

### How to avoid

- Implement backup procedures before production
- Test disaster recovery procedures regularly
- Document recovery procedures
- Define RTO/RPO objectives
