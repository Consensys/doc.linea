:::info

This guide is under development. Node removal procedures will be documented here.

:::

Removing a node from your network requires:

- Ensuring minimum node count for consensus (4 nodes for QBFT)
- Updating validator set if removing a consensus node
- Updating static peer lists
- Graceful shutdown procedures
