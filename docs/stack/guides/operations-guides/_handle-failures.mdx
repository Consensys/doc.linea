:::info

This guide is under development. Component failure handling procedures will be documented here.

:::

Component failures require different responses depending on the component:

- Consensus layer failures: Block production stops
- Execution layer failures: Transaction execution stops
- Coordinator failures: Finalization delayed
- Prover failures: Proof generation blocked
- State manager failures: Proof generation blocked

For information about failure modes, see [Boundaries & Responsibilities](../../how-it-works/boundaries-responsibilities.mdx).
