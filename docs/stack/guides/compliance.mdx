The Linea protocol and operator stack offers the opportunity to configure compliance and audit capabilities. Such capabilities are provided through both protocol guarantees and operator-controlled integrations.

## Define auditability capabilities

### Auditability features (Linea)

- Protocol-level transaction records
- State commitment proofs
- Finalization records on the finalization layer
- Deterministic replay and verification

### Compliance enablement (Operator)

- Privacy-preserving execution models (Private Validium)
- Selective disclosure implementations
- Controlled access to state and data
- Integration with external compliance and monitoring systems

## Define data retention and selective disclosure

### Protocol support (Linea)

- State commitment retention rules
- Protocol-level selective disclosure primitives (Private Validium)

### Deployment controls (Operator)

- Data retention and deletion policies
- Archive node deployment
- Auditor and regulator access controls
- Disclosure audit trails
