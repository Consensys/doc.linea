This section provides detailed, component-specific deployment guides. For an orchestrated,
step-by-step path to deploy your first network, start with [run your own network](../run-your-own-network/index.mdx).

These guides provide detailed procedures for deploying individual components. Use them after
completing the orchestration guide or when you need component-specific deployment details.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- Hardware: Sufficient compute, memory, and storage resources for your component types
- Software: Docker v24 or higher and Docker Compose v2.19+ (recommended for all deployments)
- Network: Proper network configuration for P2P communication
- Access: Required credentials and permissions for your infrastructure

:::tip

All deployment guides use Docker as the primary method. Docker simplifies installation, updates,
version management, and operational procedures. Binary distributions are available as alternatives
only when Docker is not available in your environment.

## Deployment guides

### Private Validium

Deploy a private Validium network with offchain data availability:

- [Deploy Private Validium network](./deploy-private-validium.mdx)

### Common deployment tasks

These guides apply to all deployment models:

- [Deploy consensus layer (Maru)](./deploy-maru.mdx)
- [Deploy execution layer](./deploy-execution-layer.mdx)

:::info[Additional component guides]

Guides for deploying sequencer, coordinator, prover, and state manager are under development.

## Deployment considerations

### Resource requirements

Component resource requirements vary by role:

- Consensus layer (Maru): Moderate CPU and memory; minimal storage
- Execution layer (full node): High CPU and memory; significant storage growth
- Execution layer (archive node): Very high storage requirements
- Sequencer: High CPU and memory; moderate storage
- Coordinator: Moderate CPU and memory; file system for batch data
- Prover: Very high CPU (proof generation is computationally intensive)
- State manager: High memory and storage for state representation

For local development, Docker should have approximately 16 GB memory and 4+ CPUs to run the entire
stack.

### Network topology

Plan your network topology:

- P2P networking: Ensure nodes can communicate via P2P ports
- Internal services: Sequencer, coordinator, and prover should be on private networks
- RPC access: RPC nodes may be behind load balancers and access controls
- Minimum nodes: 4 nodes minimum for QBFT consensus fault tolerance

### Data availability

Choose your data availability strategy:

- Private Validium: Private node set for data storage
- Hybrid: Selective onchain/offchain data availability
- Public: Onchain data via EIP-4844 blobs

## Next steps

After deployment:

1. Establish operational procedures using [Operations guides](../operations-guides/index.mdx).
2. Set up monitoring and alerting.
3. Test failure scenarios and recovery procedures.
