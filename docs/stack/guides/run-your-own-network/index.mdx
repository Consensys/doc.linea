This guide provides an opinionated, step-by-step path to deploy and operate your own Linea network.
Follow these steps in order to reduce choice paralysis and ensure a successful deployment.

## Overview

Running your own Linea network requires understanding deployment models, meeting prerequisites, deploying
a minimal viable network, and then hardening for production. This guide orchestrates the process,
linking to detailed guides as needed.

## Steps

1. **[Choose a deployment model](/stack/guides/run-your-own-network/choose-deployment-model)**: Select
   the deployment model that matches your requirements and trust assumptions.

2. **[Prerequisites](/stack/guides/run-your-own-network/prerequisites)**: Verify you have the hardware,
   software, and access required for your chosen deployment model.

3. **[Minimal viable network](/stack/guides/run-your-own-network/minimal-viable-network)**: Deploy the
   smallest supported setup to validate your infrastructure and understand component interactions.

4. **[Production hardening](/stack/guides/run-your-own-network/production-hardening)**: Apply security,
   monitoring, and operational best practices before handling production workloads.

5. **[What's next](/stack/guides/run-your-own-network/whats-next)**: Ongoing operations, scaling, and
   maintenance procedures.

## When to use this guide

Use this guide if:

- You are deploying your first Linea network
- You want a clear, opinionated path without choice paralysis
- You need to understand what's required vs. recommended
- You want to validate your setup before production

## When to use detailed guides

After completing this orchestration guide, use the detailed guides for:

- **[Deployment Guides](/stack/guides/deployment-guides)**: Component-specific deployment procedures
- **[Configuration Guides](/stack/guides/configuration-guides)**: Advanced configuration options
- **[Operations Guides](/stack/guides/operations-guides)**: Ongoing operational procedures
