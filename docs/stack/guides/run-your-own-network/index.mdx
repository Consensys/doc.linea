This guide aims to provide a step-by-step path to deploy and operate your own Linea network.
Follow these steps to get some help deciding based on your needs and ensure a successful deployment.

## Overview

Running your own Linea network requires understanding deployment models, meeting prerequisites, deploying
a minimal viable network, and then hardening for production. This guide orchestrates the process,
linking to detailed guides as needed.

## Steps

1. [Choose a deployment model](./choose-deployment-model.mdx): Select
   the deployment model that matches your requirements and trust assumptions.

2. [Prerequisites](./prerequisites.mdx): Verify you have the hardware,
   software, and access required for your chosen deployment model.

3. [Minimal viable network](./minimal-viable-network.mdx): Deploy the
   smallest supported setup to validate your infrastructure and understand component interactions.

4. [Production hardening](./production-hardening.mdx): Apply security,
   monitoring, and operational best practices before handling production workloads.

5. [Operations](../operations-guides/index.mdx): Ongoing operations, scaling, and maintenance
   procedures.

## When to use this guide

Use this guide if:

- You are deploying your first Linea network
- You need help deciding which type of deployment will meet your needs
- You need to understand what's required vs. recommended
- You want to validate your setup before production

## When to use detailed guides

After completing this orchestration guide, use the detailed guides for:

- **[Deployment guides](../deployment-guides/index.mdx)**: Component-specific deployment procedures
  (includes configuration options)
- **[Operations guides](../operations-guides/index.mdx)**: Ongoing operational procedures
