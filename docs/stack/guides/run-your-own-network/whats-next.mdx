After deploying and hardening your network, establish ongoing operational procedures for scaling,
maintenance, and troubleshooting.

## Ongoing operations

### Monitoring

- **Daily**: Review component health and performance metrics
- **Weekly**: Review network health and transaction throughput
- **Monthly**: Review capacity planning and scaling needs

### Maintenance

- **Regular updates**: Plan for component version updates
- **Configuration tuning**: Optimize configuration based on observed performance
- **Capacity planning**: Monitor resource usage and plan for scaling

### Troubleshooting

- **Common issues**: Familiarize yourself with [Common mistakes](/stack/guides/operations-guides/common-mistakes) and troubleshooting procedures
- **Escalation**: Know when to escalate issues and how to contact support

## Scaling

### Horizontal scaling

- **RPC nodes**: Add RPC nodes behind load balancer as demand increases
- **[Prover](/protocol/prover) instances**: Add prover instances to handle increased proof generation load
- **Execution nodes**: Add execution nodes for increased transaction throughput

### Vertical scaling

- **Resource allocation**: Increase CPU, memory, and storage for resource-intensive components
- **Performance tuning**: Optimize configuration for your workload

See <!-- todo: does this need to be built out [Scaling](/stack/guides/operations-guides/scaling) --> scaling strategies for detailed information.

## Maintenance procedures

### Regular maintenance

- **Software updates**: Regular component version updates
- **Configuration reviews**: Periodic configuration reviews and optimization
- **Security audits**: Regular security audits and access control reviews

### Planned maintenance

- **Maintenance windows**: Schedule and communicate maintenance windows
- **Zero-downtime updates**: Plan for zero-downtime updates where possible

See <!-- todo: does this need to be built out [Maintenance](/stack/guides/operations-guides/maintenance) --> maintenance procedures for detailed information.

## Operational runbooks

Establish runbooks for common operational tasks:

- <!-- todo: does this need to be built out [Add a new node](/stack/guides/operations-guides/add-node) -->
- <!-- todo: does this need to be built out [Remove a node](/stack/guides/operations-guides/remove-node) -->
- <!-- todo: does this need to be built out [Update component versions](/stack/guides/operations-guides/update-versions) -->
- <!-- todo: does this need to be built out [Handle component failures](/stack/guides/operations-guides/handle-failures) -->

## Disaster recovery

- **Regular testing**: Test disaster recovery procedures regularly
- **Backup verification**: Verify backups are working correctly
- **Recovery procedures**: Keep recovery procedures up to date

See <!-- todo: does this need to be built out [Disaster recovery](/stack/guides/operations-guides/disaster-recovery) --> disaster recovery procedures for detailed information.

## Community and support

### Resources

- **Documentation**: Keep up to date with documentation updates
- **Community**: Engage with the Linea community for best practices
- **Support**: Know how to contact support for issues

### Contributing

- **Feedback**: Provide feedback on documentation and procedures
- **Improvements**: Contribute improvements to operational procedures
