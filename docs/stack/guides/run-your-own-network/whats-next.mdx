After deploying and hardening your network, establish ongoing operational procedures for scaling,
maintenance, and troubleshooting.

## Ongoing operations

### Monitoring

- Daily: Review component health and performance metrics
- Weekly: Review network health and transaction throughput
- Monthly: Review capacity planning and scaling needs

### Maintenance

- Regular updates: Plan for component version updates
- Configuration tuning: Optimize configuration based on observed performance
- Capacity planning: Monitor resource usage and plan for scaling

### Troubleshooting

- Common issues: Familiarize yourself with [Common mistakes](/stack/guides/operations-guides/common-mistakes) and troubleshooting procedures
- Escalation: Know when to escalate issues and how to contact support

## Scaling

### Horizontal scaling

- RPC nodes: Add RPC nodes behind load balancer as demand increases
- [Prover](/protocol/prover) instances: Add prover instances to handle increased proof generation load
- Execution nodes: Add execution nodes for increased transaction throughput

### Vertical scaling

- Resource allocation: Increase CPU, memory, and storage for resource-intensive components
- Performance tuning: Optimize configuration for your workload

Detailed scaling strategies are documented in [Operations guides](/stack/guides/operations-guides).

## Maintenance procedures

### Regular maintenance

- Software updates: Regular component version updates
- Configuration reviews: Periodic configuration reviews and optimization
- Security audits: Regular security audits and access control reviews

### Planned maintenance

- Maintenance windows: Schedule and communicate maintenance windows
- Zero-downtime updates: Plan for zero-downtime updates where possible

Detailed maintenance procedures are documented in [Operations guides](/stack/guides/operations-guides).

## Operational runbooks

Establish runbooks for common operational tasks:

- Add a new node
- Remove a node
- Update component versions
- Handle component failures

See [Operations guides](/stack/guides/operations-guides) for detailed runbooks.

## Disaster recovery

- Regular testing: Test disaster recovery procedures regularly
- Backup verification: Verify backups are working correctly
- Recovery procedures: Keep recovery procedures up to date

Detailed disaster recovery procedures are documented in [Operations guides](/stack/guides/operations-guides).

## Community and support

### Resources

- Documentation: Keep up to date with documentation updates
- Community: Engage with the Linea community for best practices
- Support: Know how to contact support for issues

### Contributing

- Feedback: Provide feedback on documentation and procedures
- Improvements: Contribute improvements to operational procedures
