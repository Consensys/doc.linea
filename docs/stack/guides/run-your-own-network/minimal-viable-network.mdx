A minimal viable network (MVN) is the smallest supported setup that validates your infrastructure
and demonstrates component interactions. Use this setup for development, testing, and understanding
the system before production deployment.

## What components must be running

A minimal viable network requires these components:

1. **Consensus layer**: [Maru](/protocol/repos#maru) with QBFT consensus (minimum 4 nodes)
2. **Execution layer**: [Linea Besu](/protocol/repos#linea-besu-upstream) nodes (sequencer + at least one full node)
3. **[Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator)**: Orchestrates proof generation and finalization
4. **[Prover](/protocol/prover)**: Generates zero-knowledge proofs (at least one instance)
5. **[State manager](/protocol/state-manager)**: Maintains state for proof generation

### Component roles

- **Consensus layer**: Handles block production and consensus
- **Execution layer (sequencer)**: Orders and executes transactions into blocks
- **Execution layer (full nodes)**: Serve RPC requests and maintain state
- **[Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator)**: Groups blocks into batches and coordinates proof generation
- **[Prover](/protocol/prover)**: Generates proofs for batches
- **[State manager](/protocol/state-manager)**: Provides state data for proof generation

## What can be stubbed or deferred

These components can be simplified or deferred in a minimal viable network:

- **RPC nodes**: A single full node can serve RPC requests (no load balancing required)
- **Archive nodes**: Not required for MVN (only needed for historical data access)
- **Multiple prover instances**: Single prover instance is sufficient for MVN
- **RBAC and API portal**: Can be deferred for Private Validium MVN (add before production)
- **Data availability redundancy**: Single node set is sufficient for MVN testing
- **Monitoring and alerting**: Basic logging is sufficient for MVN (comprehensive monitoring required
  for production)

## Required vs. recommended

### Required for MVN

- All core components listed above
- Minimum 4 nodes for QBFT consensus
- Basic network connectivity between components
- Connection to finalization layer (for finalization testing; see [Data availability and
  finalization](/stack/how-it-works/data-availability-finalization) for details on finalization
  layer requirements)

### Recommended for MVN

- Docker Compose for orchestration
- Basic monitoring (logs, component health)
- Backup of configuration and keys
- Test transaction submission and execution

### Required for production (not MVN)

- RBAC and access controls (Private Validium)
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Production hardening (see [Production hardening](/stack/guides/run-your-own-network/production-hardening))
- Data availability redundancy
- Multiple prover instances for redundancy

## Security guarantees missing in MVN

A minimal viable network does not provide:

- **Production-grade security**: MVN is for development and testing only
- **High availability**: Single instances of components (no redundancy)
- **Access controls**: RBAC and API portal deferred (Private Validium)
- **Comprehensive monitoring**: Basic logging only
- **Disaster recovery**: No tested backup and recovery procedures
- **Network isolation**: May use shared networks for simplicity

## What this setup is not suitable for

Do not use a minimal viable network for:

- **Production workloads**: Missing security, monitoring, and redundancy
- **Regulated financial applications**: Missing compliance controls and audit trails
- **High-availability requirements**: No redundancy or failover
- **Production data**: No tested backup and recovery
- **Public access**: Missing access controls and security hardening

## Deployment steps

1. **Deploy consensus layer**: [Deploy Maru](/stack/guides/deployment-guides/deploy-maru) with minimum 4 nodes
2. **Deploy execution layer**: [Deploy execution layer](/stack/guides/deployment-guides/deploy-execution-layer)
   with sequencer and at least one full node
3. **Deploy coordinator**: See coordinator deployment guide (placeholder)
4. **Deploy prover**: See prover deployment guide (placeholder)
5. **Deploy state manager**: See state manager deployment guide (placeholder)
6. **Verify deployment**: Test transaction submission, execution, and finalization

## Validation checklist

After deploying your MVN, verify:

- [ ] All components are running and healthy
- [ ] P2P connectivity between nodes
- [ ] Transaction submission and execution
- [ ] Proof generation and finalization
- [ ] RPC endpoints responding
- [ ] Basic monitoring (logs, component health)

## Next steps

After validating your minimal viable network:

1. Understand what's missing for production (see [Production hardening](/stack/guides/run-your-own-network/production-hardening))
2. Test failure scenarios to understand component dependencies
3. Plan production deployment with required security, monitoring, and redundancy
