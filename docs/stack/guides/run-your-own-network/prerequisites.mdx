Before deploying your Linea network, verify you have the required hardware, software, and access.
Requirements vary by deployment model and component role.

## Hardware requirements

### Minimum viable network

For a minimal viable network (development/testing):

- Docker: v24 or higher with ~16 GB memory and 4+ CPUs
- Storage: Sufficient for chain data growth (varies by node type)
- Network: Connectivity for P2P communication between nodes

### Production network

For production deployments, requirements vary by component:

- Consensus layer ([Maru](../../../protocol/repos.mdx#maru)): Moderate CPU and memory per node; minimal storage
- Execution layer (full node): High CPU and memory; significant storage growth
- Execution layer (archive node): Very high storage requirements
- [Sequencer](../../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/index.mdx): High CPU and memory; moderate storage
- [Coordinator](../../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx): Moderate CPU and memory; file system for batch data
- [Prover](../../../protocol/architecture/prover/index.mdx): Very high CPU (proof generation is computationally intensive)
- [State manager](../../../protocol/architecture/state-manager.mdx): High memory and storage for state representation

Plan for redundancy and scaling based on your workload and availability requirements.

## Software requirements

### Required

- Docker: v24 or higher (recommended for all deployments)
- Docker Compose: v2.19+ (for multi-component deployments)
- Network configuration: Proper network setup for P2P communication

### Optional

- Binary distributions: Available as alternatives when Docker is not available
- Kubernetes: For orchestrated deployments (advanced)

:::tip

Docker is the recommended deployment method. Docker simplifies installation, updates, version
management, and operational procedures.

## Access requirements

### Infrastructure access

- Credentials and permissions for your infrastructure
- Network configuration access (firewall rules, load balancers)
- Storage provisioning capabilities

### Finalization layer access

- Connection to finalization layer (Ethereum or Linea Mainnet)
- Smart contracts: Rollup and verifier contracts deployed on finalization layer (required for
  proof verification)
- Gas for finalization submissions
- Monitoring for finalization submissions

For details on finalization layer requirements, L2/L3 relationships, and smart contract
deployment, see [data availability and finalization](../../how-it-works/data-availability-finalization.mdx).

### Private Validium additional requirements

- RBAC system: For RPC endpoint and API access controls
- API portal: For institution onboarding and management
- Key management: Web3Signer with KMS for signing operations
- Data availability infrastructure: Private node set

## Network topology

Plan your network topology:

- P2P networking: Ensure nodes can communicate via P2P ports
- Internal services: [Sequencer](../../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/index.mdx), [coordinator](../../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx), and [prover](../../../protocol/architecture/prover/index.mdx) should be on private networks
- RPC access: RPC nodes may be behind load balancers and access controls
- Minimum nodes: 4 nodes minimum for QBFT consensus fault tolerance

## Validator set requirements

For QBFT consensus:

- Minimum nodes: 4 nodes for fault tolerance (3f+1 where f is the number of faulty nodes)
- Fault tolerance: Can tolerate up to 1/3 of nodes being faulty
- Network partitions: Partitions affecting more than 1/3 of nodes can cause consensus failure

## Security considerations

Before production:

- Key management strategy (Web3Signer with KMS recommended)
- Access control configuration (RBAC for Private Validium)
- Network isolation and firewall rules
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Next steps

After verifying prerequisites:

1. Deploy a [minimal viable network](./minimal-viable-network.mdx) to
   validate your setup
2. Review [production hardening](./production-hardening.mdx)
   requirements
