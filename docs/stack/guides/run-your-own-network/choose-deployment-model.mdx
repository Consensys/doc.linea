Your first decision is choosing a deployment model. This choice should be based on your needs and determines data availability, network
topology, access controls, and operational complexity.

## Decision matrix

| Capability | Private Validium | Hybrid | Public |
|------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| Transaction privacy | ✅ Full compatibility | ⚠️ Selective | ❌ None |
| Regulatory compliance (KYC/KYT) | ✅ Full compatibility | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ None |
| Onchain data availability | ❌ Offchain by default | ⚠️ Selective | ✅ Full |
| RBAC on RPC endpoints | ✅ Full compatibility | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ None |
| Private network topology | ✅ Full compatibility | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ None |
| Operational complexity | High | Very high | Moderate |

## Use cases

### Private Validium

Best for **regulated financial applications** requiring transaction privacy, KYC/KYT compliance, 
selective data disclosure to auditors, and controlled network membership with RBAC.

**Avoid if** you don't need privacy or compliance controls, prefer onchain data availability 
guarantees, or want to minimize operational complexity.

**Required components:**

- Consensus layer ([Maru](../../../protocol/repos.mdx#maru)) with QBFT (minimum 4 nodes)
- Execution layer ([Linea Besu](../../../protocol/repos.mdx#linea-besu-upstream) recommended)
- [Sequencer](../../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/index.mdx)
- [Coordinator](../../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx) and
  [prover](../../../protocol/architecture/prover/index.mdx)
- [State manager](../../../protocol/architecture/state-manager.mdx)
- Private RPC nodes with RBAC
- API portal (for institution onboarding)

### Hybrid

Best for networks needing **both public and private transaction types**, or organizations 
**transitioning from private to public** with flexibility in data availability strategy.

**Avoid if** Private Validium or Public can satisfy your requirements, you want to minimize 
complexity, or this is your first deployment.

Hybrid deployment model documentation is under development.

### Public

Best for **maximum transparency** with onchain data availability guarantees, without privacy or 
compliance requirements.

- You require maximum transparency
- You want onchain data availability guarantees
- You don't need transaction privacy
- You don't need regulatory compliance controls
- You want to minimize operational complexity

**Required components:**

- Consensus layer ([Maru](../../../protocol/repos.mdx#maru)) with QBFT (minimum 4 nodes)
- Execution layer ([Linea Besu](../../../protocol/repos.mdx#linea-besu-upstream),
  [Geth](../../../network/how-to/run-a-node/geth.mdx), or
  [Erigon](../../../network/how-to/run-a-node/erigon.mdx))
- [Sequencer](../../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/index.mdx)
- [Coordinator](../../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx) and [prover](../../../protocol/architecture/prover/index.mdx)
- [State manager](../../../protocol/architecture/state-manager.mdx)
- Public RPC nodes (no access controls)

**Trust assumptions:**

- Onchain data availability (EIP-4844 blobs)
- Validator set follows consensus protocol
- Finalization layer inherits security from Ethereum

**Operational complexity:** Moderate

- Standard blockchain node operations
- No RBAC or API portal management
- Simpler monitoring and troubleshooting

**When not to choose Public:**

- You require transaction privacy
- You need regulatory compliance controls
- You need RBAC on RPC endpoints

Public deployment model documentation is under development.

## Required components

All deployment models share a common base architecture. The table below highlights the differences.

| Component | Private Validium | Hybrid | Public |
|-----------|------------------|--------|--------|
| Consensus layer ([Maru](../../../protocol/repos.mdx#maru) with QBFT) | ✅ Min. 4 nodes | ✅ Min. 4 nodes | ✅ Min. 4 nodes |
| Execution layer | [Linea Besu](../../../protocol/repos.mdx#linea-besu-upstream) | [Linea Besu](../../../protocol/repos.mdx#linea-besu-upstream) | Linea Besu, [Geth](../../../network/how-to/run-a-node/geth.mdx), or [Erigon](../../../network/how-to/run-a-node/erigon.mdx) |
| [Sequencer](../../../protocol/architecture/sequencer/index.mdx) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [Coordinator](../../../protocol/architecture/coordinator.mdx) and [prover](../../../protocol/architecture/prover/index.mdx) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [State manager](../../../protocol/architecture/state-manager.mdx) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| RPC nodes | Private with RBAC | Private with RBAC | Public (no access controls) |
| API portal | ✅ For institution onboarding | ✅ | ❌ |
| Selective DA configuration | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Trust assumptions

All models inherit security from Ethereum through the finalization layer, and assume the validator 
set follows the QBFT consensus protocol.

| Aspect | Private Validium | Hybrid | Public |
|--------|------------------|--------|--------|
| Data availability | Offchain providers | Selective (offchain or onchain per tx) | Onchain (EIP-4844 blobs) |
| DA trust model | Providers make data available when needed | Mixed | Ethereum DA guarantees |

## Operational burden

| Task | Private Validium | Hybrid | Public |
|------|------------------|--------|--------|
| Private node set management | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| RBAC configuration | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| API portal operations | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| DA redundancy management | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Selective DA configuration | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Overall complexity** | High | Very high | Moderate |

## Recommendation

For most enterprise and regulated financial use cases, **Private Validium** provides the necessary
privacy, compliance, and access control features.

For public networks requiring maximum transparency, **Public** provides the simplest operational
model.

**Avoid Hybrid** for your first deployment unless you have a specific requirement that cannot be met
by Private Validium or Public.

## Next steps

After choosing your deployment model:

1. Review [prerequisites](./prerequisites.mdx) for your chosen model
2. Understand the [minimal viable network](./minimal-viable-network.mdx)
   requirements
3. Proceed to deployment
