Your first decision is choosing a deployment model. This choice determines data availability, network
topology, access controls, and operational complexity.

## Decision matrix

| Requirement | Private Validium | Hybrid | Public |
|------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| Transaction privacy | ✅ Required | ⚠️ Selective | ❌ Not required |
| Regulatory compliance (KYC/KYT) | ✅ Required | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Not required |
| Onchain data availability | ❌ Not required | ⚠️ Selective | ✅ Required |
| RBAC on RPC endpoints | ✅ Required | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Not required |
| Private network topology | ✅ Required | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Not required |
| Operational complexity | High | Very high | Moderate |

## Private Validium

**Choose Private Validium if:**

- You require transaction privacy (regulated financial applications)
- You need KYC/KYT compliance controls
- You need selective data disclosure to auditors and regulators
- You require RBAC on RPC endpoints and APIs
- You need a private network with controlled membership

**Required components:**

- Consensus layer ([Maru](/protocol/repos#maru)) with QBFT (minimum 4 nodes)
- Execution layer ([Linea Besu](/protocol/repos#linea-besu-upstream) recommended)
- [Sequencer](/protocol/sequencer)
- [Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator) and [prover](/protocol/prover)
- [State manager](/protocol/state-manager)
- Private RPC nodes with RBAC
- API portal (for institution onboarding)

**Trust assumptions:**

- Data availability providers will make data available when needed
- Validator set follows consensus protocol (QBFT provides fault tolerance)
- Finalization layer inherits security from Ethereum

**Operational complexity:** High

- Private node set management
- RBAC configuration and management
- API portal operations
- Data availability redundancy

**When not to choose Private Validium:**

- You don't need transaction privacy
- You don't need regulatory compliance controls
- You prefer onchain data availability guarantees
- You want to minimize operational complexity

## Hybrid

**Choose Hybrid if:**

- You need both public and private transaction types
- You're transitioning from private to public
- You need flexibility in data availability strategy

**Required components:**

- All Private Validium components
- Additional configuration for selective data availability

**Trust assumptions:**

- Same as Private Validium for private transactions
- Onchain data availability for public transactions

**Operational complexity:** Very high

- All Private Validium complexity
- Additional complexity managing selective data availability
- More complex monitoring and troubleshooting

**When not to choose Hybrid:**

- You can satisfy requirements with Private Validium or Public
- You want to minimize operational complexity
- You're deploying your first network

:::note

Hybrid deployment model documentation is under development. Configuration and operational procedures
will be documented as the feature matures.

## Public

**Choose Public if:**

- You require maximum transparency
- You want onchain data availability guarantees
- You don't need transaction privacy
- You don't need regulatory compliance controls
- You want to minimize operational complexity

**Required components:**

- Consensus layer ([Maru](/protocol/repos#maru)) with QBFT (minimum 4 nodes)
- Execution layer ([Linea Besu](/protocol/repos#linea-besu-upstream), [Geth](/network/how-to/run-a-node/geth), or [Erigon](/network/how-to/run-a-node/erigon))
- [Sequencer](/protocol/sequencer)
- [Coordinator](/protocol/coordinator) and [prover](/protocol/prover)
- [State manager](/protocol/state-manager)
- Public RPC nodes (no access controls)

**Trust assumptions:**

- Onchain data availability (EIP-4844 blobs)
- Validator set follows consensus protocol
- Finalization layer inherits security from Ethereum

**Operational complexity:** Moderate

- Standard blockchain node operations
- No RBAC or API portal management
- Simpler monitoring and troubleshooting

**When not to choose Public:**

- You require transaction privacy
- You need regulatory compliance controls
- You need RBAC on RPC endpoints

:::note

Public deployment model documentation is under development. Configuration and operational procedures
will be documented as the feature matures.

## Recommendation

For most enterprise and regulated financial use cases, **Private Validium** provides the necessary
privacy, compliance, and access control features.

For public networks requiring maximum transparency, **Public** provides the simplest operational
model.

**Avoid Hybrid** for your first deployment unless you have a specific requirement that cannot be met
by Private Validium or Public.

## Next steps

After choosing your deployment model:

1. Review [prerequisites](./prerequisites.mdx) for your chosen model
2. Understand the [minimal viable network](./minimal-viable-network.mdx)
   requirements
3. Proceed to deployment
