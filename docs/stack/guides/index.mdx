The Linea stack provides features and capabilities that enable various deployment models and use cases.
This section documents the features available in the Linea stack.

## Deployment model features

### Private validium

Private Validium provides:

- Offchain data availability: transaction data stored privately
- RBAC: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for RPC and API endpoints
- Privacy: transaction details not visible on finalization layer
- Compliance: KYC/KYT controls and selective data disclosure
- API portal: controlled access to network functionality

See more on [private validiums](./validium.mdx).

### Public

Public deployments provide:

- Onchain data availability: Public Mainnet posts all data via EIP-4844 blobs to Ethereum
- Full transparency: All transactions visible on finalization layer
- Open access: No access controls required

## Core features

### Zero-knowledge proofs

The Linea stack uses zero-knowledge proofs to:

- Verify state transitions without revealing transaction details
- Provide cryptographic guarantees of correctness
- Enable efficient finalization on the finalization layer


### EVM equivalence

Full EVM compatibility enables:

- Deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts without modification
- Use standard Ethereum tooling and libraries
- Maintain compatibility with Ethereum ecosystem

### Dual-layer architecture

Separation of consensus and execution provides:

- Client diversity and network resilience
- Modular deployment and scaling
- Operational flexibility

### Quorum-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus

Quorum-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT) consensus enables:

- Fault tolerance (3f+1 nodes)
- Fast finality
- Decentralized block production (with sufficient validators)
