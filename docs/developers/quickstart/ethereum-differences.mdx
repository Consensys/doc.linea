# Differences between Ethereum and Linea

## EVM opcodes

:::info important Linea uses the London version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). All EVM opcodes are managed identically to Ethereum London unless presented in the following table.

Solidity 8.23 and later compiles newer versions of the EVM by default. Use the `solc --evm-version london` command to ensure compatibility with Linea. :::

Check out [Ethereum's history](https://ethereum.org/en/history/) to learn about major milestones, forks, and updates to the blockchain.

> ⚠️ At the moment we do not support the `eth_newFilter` and `eth_newBlockFilter` RPC calls.

    <th>Explanation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`BLOBHASH`</td>
    <td>Returns a versioned hash.</td>
    <td>n/a</td>
    <td>Unavailable on Linea due to being introduced in the Cancun upgrade.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`BLOBBASEFEE`</td>
    <td>Returns the value of the blob base-fee of the current block.</td>
    <td>n/a</td>
    <td>Unavailable on Linea due to being introduced in the Cancun upgrade.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`DIFFICULTY`/`PREVRANDAO`</td>
    <td>Returns the RANDAO value from the previous block</td>
    <td>Returns a fixed number: `2`</td>
    <td>
      In Ethereum, `PREVRANDAO` was previously known as `DIFFICULTY`. It was
      renamed to `PREVRANDAO` in
      [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399) and its functionality
      changed due to the switch from PoW to PoS. `PREVRANDAO` returns a full
      256-bit value that represents the randomness beacon output of the previous
      block. For more, see the 'Security Considerations' section of EIP-4399.

  <tr>
    <td>`MCOPY`</td>
    <td>
      Copies memory areas, allowing the destination and source to overlap.

    <td>n/a</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`PUSH0`</td>
    <td>Pushes the constant value 0 onto the stack</td>
    <td>n/a</td>
    <td>
      PUSH0 was introduced in the Ethereum Mainnet Shanghai upgrade and became
      available in Solidity compiler version 0.8.20, which came after the London
      release. However, Linea currently supports compiled code targeting the
      London release of the Ethereum Mainnet. Using the EVM Version of London
      when compiling, or using Solidity compiler 0.8.19 or lower will align with
      Linea's capabilities.

## Precompiles

### Precompiles as transaction recipients

On Linea, transactions cannot set the recipient of a transaction (the address in `to`) as a precompile. The `to` address of transactions cannot be in the range `0x01`-`0x09`.

### MODEXP

`MODEXP` (`0x05`) on Linea currently only supports arguments (base, exponent, modulus) that do not exceed 512-byte integers.

### Point evaluation

The point evaluation precompile was introduced in [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#point-evaluation-precompile), and is therefore unavailable on Linea.

## JSON RPC API

Linea uses the standard Ethereum JSON RPC API methods. However, in a few cases, methods differ from those on Ethereum. These methods are documented in the [reference section](../reference/api/).
