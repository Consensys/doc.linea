In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating a basic Remix project and
deploying a sample contract.

## Explore the Remix workspace

To start using Remix, navigate to their [website](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
The default project includes a code sample with a configured smart contract.

      alt="Remix configured smart contract code"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Compile a Remix contract

Navigate to the **Solidity compiler** tab on the left navigation and click
**Compile contract**.

      alt="Remix compile contract"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Deploy the contract

You can deploy a smart contract using the injected provider, meaning Remix can
auto-detect the network you're on and your account information. To do this,
navigate to the **Deploy & run transactions** tab.

:::caution

The public endpoints are rate limited and not meant for production systems. To
use Infura, you'll need to
[get an API key](https://docs.infura.io/api/getting-started). Then,
[manually add a network to your MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC#h_01G63GGJ83DGDRCS2ZWXM37CV5)
using the [network information](../info-contracts.mdx#network-information).

:::

Switch to the Linea network (mainnet or testnets) in your MetaMask wallet, and
from the **ENVIRONMENT** drop down, select **Injected provider - MetaMask**.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">
    <img
      src="/img/developers/quickstart/deploy_smart_contract/remix/Linea_deploy_smart_contract_Remix_3.png"
      alt="Remix deploy contract"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Then, select **Deploy** and confirm the transaction. This deploys the contract
to the network selected in MetaMask.
