As a dapp developer, retrieving on-chain data for your dapp can be challenging because you will most likely:

1. Consume your RPC provider quota with calls.
2. Need to implement error handling on multiple levels.
3. Define creative strategies to avoid UX impacts when managing a high volume of data.

The Graph is a decentralized data indexer provider that indexes the Linea blockchain for you and exposes on-chain data through an HTTPS API.

We run The Graph indexers on Linea to allow you to leverage the power of this technology.

:::info[update]

TheGraph is now live with Linea Mainnet! For more information, take a look at their official [documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/)
