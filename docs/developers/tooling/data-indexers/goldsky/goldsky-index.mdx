To get started with Goldsky Index:

1. Create an account at **[app.goldsky.com](https://app.goldsky.com/)**.
2. Choose a plan that best fits your needs.
3. Create an API key on
   the **[Settings page](https://app.goldsky.com/dashboard/settings)**.
4. Install the Goldsky CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @goldskycom/cli
   ```

5. Log in with the API key created earlier:

   ```bash
   goldsky login
   ```

6. Deploy your subgraph

   ```bash
   cd <your-subgraph-directory>
   graph build # Build your subgraph as normal.
   goldsky subgraph deploy my-subgraph/1.0.0
   ```

7. Alternative, subgraphs can be deployed using Goldsky’s instant subgraph
   functionality

   ```bash
   goldsky subgraph deploy <subgraphName>/<subgraphVersion> --from-abi <path-to-config-file>
   ```

   Config files for instant subgraphs are written in JSON and outline key
   information such as the chain, contract address, and path to ABI file.
   Example of a basic configuration file below.

   ```bash
   {
     "version": "1",
     "name": "TokenDeployed",
     "abis": {
       "TokenRegistry": {
         "path": "./abis/token-registry.json"
       }
     },
     "chains": ["mainnet"],
     "instances": [
       {
         "abi": "TokenRegistry",
         "address": "0x0A6f564C5c9BeBD66F1595f1B51D1F3de6Ef3b79",
         "startBlock": 13983724,
         "chain": "mainnet"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

8. Once deployed, you can access data using the GraphQL API link provided, and
   review all deployed subgraphs with `goldsky subgraph list` or at
   app.goldsky.com.
