Noves is a leading provider of interpreted, human-readable data in the EVM
space. Our flagship product,
[Translate API](https://docs.noves.fi/reference/introduction), allows developers
to retrieve transactions in enriched, human-readable form.

For a sample, check out [Linea for Humans](https://linea.forhumans.app), a
human-readable block explorer built by Noves for Linea.

Translate covers more than 50 transaction types in its interpretation schema,
including common transactions such as claiming rewards or staking (across
thousands of protocols), but also more niche types such as governance
delegation, MEV, NFT transformations, and
[more](https://docs.noves.fi/reference/token).

## Cross-DEX pricing data

The Pricing API supports many DEX protocols on Linea, allowing developers to
price a variety of tokens and LP tokens on the chain.

The API also offers historical pricing with block-level granularity. The price
of any token/LP token can be requested as of a specific block. This is
particularly useful for financial applications or reporting, where establishing
a precise cost-basis is necessary.
