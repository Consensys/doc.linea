[DipDup](https://dipdup.io/) is a Python framework for building smart contract indexers.
It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a boilerplate to store and serve data.
DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.
