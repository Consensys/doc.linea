An attestation is evidence or proof of something, issued by a given authority.

Some common examples of attestations are:

- Passport: Proof of citizenship, and ability to travel internationally
- University degree: Proof of education
- Driver's license: Proof of being able and legally approved to drive a car

In the world of web3, attestations can prove digital identity, ownership of digital assets, and more.

This space is currently rapidly evolving, and use cases for attestations are still being discovered and built.
