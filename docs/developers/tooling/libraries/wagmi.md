Wagmi is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with Linea. 

Wagmi makes it easy for users to "Connect Wallet," display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more — all with caching, request deduplication, and persistence. Wagmi supports Linea (along with MetaMask). 

To point to your dapp on Linea, you need to use the chain tag 'lineaTestnet' for Linea Goerli Testnet, and `linea` for Linea Mainnet.
