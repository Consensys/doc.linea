## Superpowers for your Web3 stack

The Biconomy SDK provides solutions for decentralized applications (dapps) that
streamline and simplify tasks from onboarding to user engagement while
respecting self-custody. It is a one-stop solution to enable an effortless
experience in your dapp: it eases onboarding for new users and abstracts away
transaction complexities that your users face on a daily basis. This is enabled
by using Smart Contract Wallets (SCW) built on top of our multi-chain Relayer
Infrastructure.
