## Smart Wallet-as-a-Service on Linea

[Particle Network](https://particle.network)'s Wallet Abstraction services
enable universal, Web2-adjacent onboarding and interactions. Its core
technology,
[Smart Wallet-as-a-Service](https://blog.particle.network/announcing-our-smart-wallet-as-a-service-modular-stack-upgrading-waas-with-erc-4337)
(WaaS) aims to onboard users into MPC-secured smart accounts supporting any
chain. It also allows developers to offer an improved user experience through
modular, fully customizable EOA/AA embedded wallets. Particle supports its Smart
Wallet-as-a-Service through a Modular L1 powering chain abstraction, acting as a
settlement layer across chains for a seamless multi-chain experience.

Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service is compatible with Linea through
both usage of EOAs (traditional accounts) and AA (smart accounts). This AA
support extends to Particle Network's
[in-house Bundler](https://developers.particle.network/docs/bundler) and
[Omnichain Paymaster](https://developers.particle.network/docs/paymaster)
infrastructure, both of which are compatible with Linea.

Thus, developers can leverage Particle Network to onboard users into smart
accounts using social login, then facilitate full-stack ERC-4337 account
abstraction through it's
[native AA SDKs](https://developers.particle.network/docs/aa-web-quickstart),
available across six platforms.
