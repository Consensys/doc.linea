[Hypernative](https://hypernative.io/) stops zero-day cyber attacks, economic
risks, detects on-chain anomalies, and protects digital assets, protocols, and
Web3 applications from significant losses or threats.

Powered by our “pre-cog” platform, Hypernative monitors on and offchain data
sources using our proprietary machine learning models to accurately predict
cyber, economic, and governance threats before they manifest. The detections are
then connected to various automated playbooks to prevent and mitigate risks in
real time.
