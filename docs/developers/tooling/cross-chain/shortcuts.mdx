A Shortcut allows users to execute onchain actions by sending funds to a
contract address.

Each Shortcut is a unique smart contract designed to carry out the desired
function. Shortcuts are represented by ENS domains, making addresses
human-readable.

:::note

Shortcuts currently only supports Ethereum Mainnet as the source chain, unless
explicitly specified by the Shortcut description. Shortcut addresses are not
chain-agnostic, but are different from network to network. Sending ETH (or other
tokens) to the wrong network may result in a loss of funds.

:::

## How it works (user flow)

A simple use case for a Shortcut could involve a user who wants to streamline
the process of bridging ETH to Linea:

1. A user sends ETH to a Shortcut address
2. The ETH is automatically bridged to Linea via [Across](https://across.to/)
3. The ETH is returned as native Linea ETH to the sender on the destination
   chain (Linea).

More complex Shortcuts can do additional things: bridge and swap, bridge and
deposit to a liquidity pool, bridge and stake/restake. The developer's
imagination is the only limit.

## How it works (technical)

Shortcuts trigger actions using a fallback function in the smart contract called
`receive()`. This allows users to initiate a transaction without approvals. The
contract engages with Across intent-based listeners and paths that will execute
the action on the destination chain.

The output token(s) from the automation are returned to `msg.sender` (the
account that called the function; in this case, the person using the Shortcut).

## Onthis Snap

A MetaMask Snap has been built specifically to help you verify that a Shortcut
is behaving as intended.

:::info[MetaMask Snaps]

MetaMask Snaps is a system that enables third-party developers to add features
and functionality to MetaMask. Read more in the
[MetaMask Help Center](https://support.metamask.io/metamask-snaps), or visit the
[Snaps directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/) to browse what's available.

:::

Before you send funds to the Shortcut, the Snap automatically recognizes that
the transaction involves an Onthis Shortcut, and provides a breakdown of:

- The contract address, enabling you to confirm it is correct
- A description of what will happen once you send funds to the Shortcut.

Install the Snap by heading either to the
[Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/onthis-snap/) or the
[dedicated Onthis page](https://www.onthis.xyz/snap), and then hitting 'Add to
MetaMask'.

## Fees

Shortcuts are provided by [onthis.xyz](https://www.onthis.xyz/) and are built on
top of [Across](https://across.to/). Both services charge users a fee on the
origin network. This fee covers the bridging costs and automation costs and is
shared between the two providers. The fee is calculated as a percentage of the
amount transferred, and is on top of the network gas fee paid to execute the
action on the origin chain.

Here is an example of the Shortcuts fee model:

| Amount ($) | Swap + bridge fees |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 100        | 5.4% ($5.40)       |
| 500        | 0.5% ($0.50)       |
| 1,000      | 0.5% ($5.00)       |
| 10,000     | 0.5% ($50.00)      |
| 100,000    | 0.5% ($500.00)     |

## Risks

Shortcuts do not store value, so the smart contract risk is lower than a
traditional dapps. Since they are built on Across, they share its risk profile.

There are several other risks inherent in Shortcuts:

### Chain-dependent addressing

Every Shortcut has a different contract address. Even the same Shortcut deployed
on two different networks (Ethereum Mainnet and Arbitrum, for example) will have
a different address. Moreover, Shortcuts only work with ETH. Sending tokens
(ERC-20, ERC-721, or others) to a Shortcut may result in a loss of funds, as
will sending ETH to a Shortcut deployed on a different network.

Linea addresses this risk by clearly identifying the Shortcut's network in its
name. If a network is specified, it means that the Shortcut can only accept ETH
on that specific network. The naming convention for Shortcut ENS names curated
by Linea is as follows:

`[network].[usecase/partner].onlinea.eth`

In practice, this could look something like:

`arbitrum.bridge.onlinea.eth`

The omission of the `[network]` prefix indicates that the Shortcut relates to
Ethereum Mainnet; `bridge.onlinea.eth`, for example, only works on Ethereum
Mainnet.

### Naming system

The easy UX of sending ETH to an ENS name can present a risk for the user. An
attacker can obtain access to the owner key of the ENS name and change the
address record, pointing it to their own wallet and collecting the funds sent
there.

Linea addresses this risk by controlling the ENS name with a multisig wallet and
assigning the manager role to the Linea Security Council (the maximum grade of
security). We also have monitors in place that listen for role changes for the
ENS name.

### Upgradability of contracts

Shortcuts can be upgraded by the creator. An attacker can upgrade the contract
and change its behavior. Linea addresses this risk by requiring trusted creators
(like the [onthis.xyz](https://www.onthis.xyz/) team) to hold the owner keys in
a secure multisig or asking the creators to hand over the ownership of the
contracts to the Linea multisig.

### Contract security

Even though Shortcuts contracts do not store value, security audits are still
important. Shortcuts created via the [Creator Tool](https://create.onthis.xyz/)
have a deterministic output that is included in the audit scope of the Creator
Tool itself. Custom built shortcuts require an independent audit.

Linea addresses this risk by including a third-party audit of the Shortcuts
listed under onlinea.eth as part of the curation process.
