LayerZero is an omnichain interoperability protocol that enables cross-chain messaging. 
Applications built on Linea can use the LayerZero protocol to seamlessly connect to 35+ supported 
blockchains.

LayerZero Endpoint has been deployed on Linea for builders to leverage omnichain messaging in 
their dapps. LayerZero's Endpoint ULNv2 validation library relies on two parties, the Oracle and 
Relayer, to transfer messages between onchain smart contracts known as endpoints. When LayerZero 
sends a message from Linea to chain `X`, the message is routed through the endpoint on Linea to the 
ULNv2 validation library. The ULNv2 library notifies the Oracle and Relayer of the message and 
its destination chain `X`. The Oracle forwards the packet hash to the endpoint on chain `X`, and the 
Relayer submits the packet to be verified onchain against the hash, and delivers the message.

As a developer, you can leverage LayerZero's Endpoint contract by using our LzApp interface for 
your User Application (UA). The Endpoint allows UAs to configure the Messaging Library for sending 
and receiving verified messages and guarantees the message-delivering ordering across all messaging 
libraries:

- `Send()`: the message will be sent through the endpoint first, and then redirected to the 
UA-configured Messaging Library. 
- `Receive()`: the message will be verified at the Messaging 
Library first, then forwarded to the endpoint and eventually delivered to the UA.
