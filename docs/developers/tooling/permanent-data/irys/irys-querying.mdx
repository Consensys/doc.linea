Irys transaction metadata can be queried using GraphQL. You can use it to search 
for transactions by:

- Signer's address
- Payment token
- Metadata tags
- Timestamps

## GraphQL clients

You can query using an HTTP library like `fetch` or `axios`, or use specialized 
clients like [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/) or [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/).

## Endpoint

https://uploader.irys.xyz/graphql

## Query arguments

Any of the following query arguments can be used as search parameters:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`ids`</td>
      <td>An array of transaction IDs passed as strings. Values are ORed together. Matching results will include transactions that have any of the supplied IDs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`owner`</td>
      <td>The address used when posting the transaction. Can be a native address from <a href="https://docs.irys.xyz/build/d/features/supported-tokens">any of the chains supported by Irys</a>. Note that in results fields, this is referred to as `address`.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`token`</td>
      <td>The <a href="https://docs.irys.xyz/build/d/features/supported-tokens">token</a> used to pay for the transaction.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`tags`</td>
      <td>An array of tag name/value pairs passed as JSON objects.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Results fields

When building a query, any of the following values be included in your results:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`id`</td>
      <td>The transaction ID.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`address`</td>
      <td>The address used when posting the transaction. Can be a native address from any of the chains supported by Irys. Note that in query arguments, this is referred to as `owner`.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`token`</td>
      <td>The token used to pay for the transaction.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	      ```
	      receipt { 
			deadlineHeight 
			signature 
			version
		  }
		  ```
	  </td>
      <td>An optional receipt, only exists if a user requested one at upload. 
	  	`deadlineHeight`: The block number by which the transaction must be finalized. 
	  	`signature`: A signed deep hash of the JSON receipt.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	      ```
	      tags { 
			name 
			value
		  }
		  ```
	  </td>
      <td>An array of tags supplied as name/value pairs. Exists if the user added them at upload.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`timestamp`</td>
      <td>The timestamp, accurate to the millisecond of when the transaction was posted. This value is the same as the receipt timestamp.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


## Sample Queries

Queries return transaction metadata. To then retrieve data, use the returned 
transaction ID and download the data from the Irys gateway using a URL formed 
as follows: `https://gateway.irys.xyz/:transactionId`.

### Transaction IDs

Search by transaction IDs.

```graphql
query getByIds {
	transactions(ids: ["--52WQHJIJod_rni8pkl1Vxt9MFGoXZAm8SC7ex6C1o", "--52THRWpX_RJzGcNXmtQ2DSP37d1e1VQ4YmvbY5ZXo"]) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				tags {
					name
					value
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Timestamps

Search by timestamps:

```graphql
query getByTimestamp {
	transactions(timestamp: { from: 1688144401000, to: 1688317201000 }) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
			}
		}
	}
}
```


:::info
Irys timestamps are accurate to the millisecond, so you need to provide a 
timestamp in millisecond format when querying. You can convert from 
human-readable time to UNIX timestamp using websites like [Epoch101](https://www.epoch101.com/), 
be sure to convert in **millisecond** format, not **second**.
:::

### Owners

Search for transactions matching the wallet address used when posting the 
transaction:

```graphql
query getByOwner {
	transactions(owners: ["0xBcb812C6e26F4F0F78Bd7B6222461FF24F2942AE", "0xaC568a981B1370B2e1bAA8cE30BD5AC9E28C572D"]) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Tags

Search for transactions matching [tag](https://docs.irys.xyz/build/d/features/tags) 
name/value pairs:

```graphql
query getAllPNGs {
	transactions(tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png"] }]) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Search for transactions matching the tag with name **Content-Type** and the 
values of **image/png** OR **image/jpg**:

```graphql
query getTagsWithOR {
	transactions(tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png", "image/jpg"] }]) {
		edges {
			node {
				tags {
					name
					value
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Search for transactions matching the tag with name **Content-Type** and the 
values of **image/png** AND **image/jpg**:

```graphql
query getTagsWithAnd {
	transactions(
		tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/jpg"] }, { name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png"] }]
	) {
		edges {
			node {
				tags {
					name
					value
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Limiting Results

Limit the number of results returned by including the `limit` parameter:

```graphql
query getAllPNGs {
	transactions(limit: 10, tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png"] }]) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Pagination

You can request a maximum of 100 results returned from each query, to obtain 
additional results use pagination.

When using pagination you:

1. Retrieve the `cursor` field. This acts like a bookmark in the search results 
that you can then return to.
2. Use saved `cursor` value to obtain subsequent search results.

The following query returns 10 transactions tagged `image/png` occurring after 
the cursor with value: `LS02d1NsM3R6aUprd3dKUzVjN1FXaWg5aUxsbXh5dVJJbGlydHJtNlpPbw`. 
To obtain the next 10 transactions, use the final `cursor` value returned from 
this query as the value of the `after` parameter in the following query.

```graphql
query getPNGs {
	transactions(
		limit: 10
		tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png"] }]
		after: "LS02d1NsM3R6aUprd3dKUzVjN1FXaWg5aUxsbXh5dVJJbGlydHJtNlpPbw"
	) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
			}
			cursor
		}
	}
}
```

### Sorting

You can sort results by timestamp in either ascending or descending order using 
the `order` field.

```graphql
query getAllByOwnerAsc {
	transactions(owners: ["0xBcb812C6e26F4F0F78Bd7B6222461FF24F2942AE"], order: ASC) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```

```graphql
query getAllByOwnerDesc {
	transactions(owners: ["0xBcb812C6e26F4F0F78Bd7B6222461FF24F2942AE"], order: DESC) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```
