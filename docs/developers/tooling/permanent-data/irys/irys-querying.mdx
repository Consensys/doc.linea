# Querying Irys Transactions

Irys transaction metadata can be queried using GraphQL. You can use it to search for transactions by:

- Signer's address
- Payment token
- Metadata tags
- Timestamps

## GraphQL Clients

You can query using an HTTP library like fetch or axios, or use specialized clients like [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/) or [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/).

## Endpoint

https://uploader.irys.xyz/graphql

## Query Arguments

Any of the following query arguments can be used as search parameters:

| Field   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ids`   | An array of transaction IDs passed as strings. Values are ORed together, matching results will include transactions that have any of the supplied IDs.                                                   |
| `owner` | The address used when posting the transaction. Can be a native address from [any of the chains supported by Irys](https://docs.irys.xyz/build/d/features/supported-tokens). Note in results fields, this is referred to as `address`. |
| `token` | The [token](https://docs.irys.xyz/build/d/features/supported-tokens) used to pay for the transaction.                                                                                                                                 |
| `tags`  | An array of tag name / value pairs passed as JSON objects.                                                                                                                                               |

## Results Fields

When building a query, any of the following values be included in your results:
| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | The transaction ID. |
| `address` | The address used when posting the transaction. Can be a native address from any of the chains supported by Irys. Note in query arguments, this is referred to as `owner`. |
| `token` | The token used to pay for the transaction. |
| `receipt { `<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`deadlineHeight `<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`signature  `<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`version `<br/>`}` | An optional receipt, only exists if a user requested one at upload.<br/> `deadlineHeight`: The block number by which the transaction must be finalized. <br/>`signature`: A signed deep hash of the JSON receipt. |
| `tags {    `<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`name     `<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`value`<br/>`}` | An array of tags supplied as name / value pairs. Exists if the user added them at upload. |
|`timestamp` | The timestamp, accurate to the millisecond of when the transaction was posted. This value is the same as the receipt timestamp. |


## Sample Queries

> Queries return transaction metadata. To then retrieve data, use the returned transaction ID and download the data from the Irys gateway using a URL formed as follows: `https://gateway.irys.xyz/:transactionId`.

### Transaction IDs

Search by transaction IDs.

```graphql
query getByIds {
	transactions(ids: ["--52WQHJIJod_rni8pkl1Vxt9MFGoXZAm8SC7ex6C1o", "--52THRWpX_RJzGcNXmtQ2DSP37d1e1VQ4YmvbY5ZXo"]) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				tags {
					name
					value
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Timestamps

Search by timestamps:

```graphql
query getByTimestamp {
	transactions(timestamp: { from: 1688144401000, to: 1688317201000 }) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
			}
		}
	}
}
```


> Irys timestamps are accurate to the millisecond, so you need to provide a timestamp in millisecond format when querying. You can
convert from human-readable time to UNIX timestamp using websites like [Epoch101](https://www.epoch101.com/), be sure
to convert in **millisecond** format, not **second**.

### Owners

Search for transactions matching the wallet address used when posting the transaction:

```graphql
query getByOwner {
	transactions(owners: ["0xBcb812C6e26F4F0F78Bd7B6222461FF24F2942AE", "0xaC568a981B1370B2e1bAA8cE30BD5AC9E28C572D"]) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Tags

Search for transactions matching [tag](https://docs.irys.xyz/build/d/features/tags) name / value pairs:

```graphql
query getAllPNGs {
	transactions(tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png"] }]) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Search for transactions matching the tag with name **Content-Type** and the values of **image/png** OR **image/jpg**:

```graphql
query getTagsWithOR {
	transactions(tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png", "image/jpg"] }]) {
		edges {
			node {
				tags {
					name
					value
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Search for transactions matching the tag with name **Content-Type** and the values of **image/png** AND **image/jpg**:

```graphql
query getTagsWithAnd {
	transactions(
		tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/jpg"] }, { name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png"] }]
	) {
		edges {
			node {
				tags {
					name
					value
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Limiting Results

Limit the number of results returned by including the `limit` parameter:

```graphql
query getAllPNGs {
	transactions(limit: 10, tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png"] }]) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Pagination

You can request a maximum of 100 results returned from each query, to obtain additional results use pagination.

When using pagination you:

1. Retrieve the `cursor` field, this acts like a bookmark in the search results you can then return to.
2. Use saved `cursor` value to obtain subsequent search results.

The following query returns 10 transactions tagged `image/png` occurring after the cursor with value: `LS02d1NsM3R6aUprd3dKUzVjN1FXaWg5aUxsbXh5dVJJbGlydHJtNlpPbw`. To then obtain the next 10 transactions, use the final `cursor` value returned from this query as the value of the `after` parameter in the following query.

```graphql
query getPNGs {
	transactions(
		limit: 10
		tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["image/png"] }]
		after: "LS02d1NsM3R6aUprd3dKUzVjN1FXaWg5aUxsbXh5dVJJbGlydHJtNlpPbw"
	) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
			}
			cursor
		}
	}
}
```

### Sorting

You can sort results by timestamp in either ascending or descending order using the `order` field.

```graphql
query getAllByOwnerAsc {
	transactions(owners: ["0xBcb812C6e26F4F0F78Bd7B6222461FF24F2942AE"], order: ASC) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```

```graphql
query getAllByOwnerDesc {
	transactions(owners: ["0xBcb812C6e26F4F0F78Bd7B6222461FF24F2942AE"], order: DESC) {
		edges {
			node {
				id
				address
			}
		}
	}
}
```
