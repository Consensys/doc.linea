# Estimate transaction costs

:::info[Reducing gas fees]

Building on gas optimizations introduced with Alpha v2 in February 2024, Linea implemented 
EIP-4844 with Alpha v3 on March 26 2024. Gas fees are anticipated to be a fraction of what they 
were. See [here](./gas-on-linea) for details.

## How gas works on Linea

Linea supports the [Ethereum EIP-1559 gas price model](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/gas). 
However, as a layer 2 blockchain, Linea provides a more stable and cost-effective solution 
for transaction fees.

There are minor differences in the way Linea handles gas calculations when compared with Ethereum:

- **The base fee uses a set price of 7 wei.** Blocks created by Linea use up to 30 million gas
    (less than 50% of the maximum Linea block size of 61 million gas), and the fee decreases by 
    12.5% per block, effectively keeping it at a stable 7 wei.
- **Transactions won't be sequenced if the `gasPrice` or `maxPriorityFeePerGas` falls below a 
    certain threshold.** This threshold is not static; it adjusts over time and varies depending 
    on the specifics of each transaction. Instead, transactions are added to the pending queue 
    until the gas price on the network drops sufficiently for the transactions to be included.

The gas cost to submit your transaction and include it on Ethereum involves the following fee 
components:

- **Layer 2 fee** - The L2 fee (execution fee) is the cost to include your transaction on the Linea
    sequencer and is calculated using a similar formula to Ethereum. 
- **Layer 1 fee** - The L1 fee is the cost to publish your L2 transaction onto Ethereum and can 
    vary based on the blob fee market.

## Estimating transaction costs

:::warning Method deactivated

The `linea_estimateGas` method used to estimate transaction fees has been temporarily deactivated
on Linea Mainnet and testnets.

:::

As Linea supports all but a few [Ethereum JSON-RPC API methods](developers/guides/linea-api), there are several 
options for estimating gas. Click through for Infura's guides on their usage:
- [`eth_estimateGas`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_estimategas) — 
Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete.
- [`eth_gasPrice`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_gasprice) — Returns 
the current gas price in wei.
- [`eth_feeHistory`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_feehistory) — 
Returns historical gas information.
