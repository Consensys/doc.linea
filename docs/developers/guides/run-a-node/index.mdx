# Run a Linea node

There are no financial incentives for running a Linea node, but it does allow you to:

- Call the Linea JSON RPC API methods and submit transactions to the mempool without relying on an 
RPC provider. Note that using [Linea-specific API methods](/developers/reference/api) such as 
`linea_estimateGas` requires Besu and may also need specific plugins to be enabled. 
- Have a local copy of the Linea blockchain. This view of the state is "trusted" until the transaction, or the
    block that transaction is in, has been finalized on L1.

:::note

Running a sequencer node is currently not possible and there is no option to vote on blocks as part of the consensus
mechanism or [fork-choice](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/forkchoice/#whats-a-fork-choice) like on Ethereum.
