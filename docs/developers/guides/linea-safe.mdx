Safe is a multi-signature smart contract wallet, which means it requires a minimum number of 
signatures to approve a transaction before it can occur. For example, if your business has three 
main stakeholders, you can configure the wallet to require approval from either two out of three 
or all three individuals before a transaction can proceed. This security measure ensures that no 
single person can compromise the funds.

On top of that, Linea Safe gives complete self-custody over funds. In other words, the smart
contract deployed for the wallet has complete control over the wallet's contents, and does not
rely on any trusted external party for execution.

To create your Safe wallet click [here](https://app.safe.global/), and select Linea as the network.
