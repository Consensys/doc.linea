# Linea

Linea is a network that **scales the experience of Ethereum**. Its **out-of-the-box compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine** enables the **deployment of already-existing applications**, as well as the creation of new ones that would be too costly on Mainnet. It also enables the community to use those dapps, **at a fraction of the cost**, and at **multiples the speed** of Mainnet.

It does this by leveraging **quantum-resistant lattice-based cryptography** to create **zero-knowledge proofs** that include every transaction performed on the network, and rolling them up to Mainnet. This ensures that **every transaction is recorded to the Ethereum ledger while dividing the cost of that security by magnitudes**.
