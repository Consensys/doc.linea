# PancakeSwap

[PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) is a leading all-in-one DeFi platform on BNB Chain, Ethereum, Aptos and now, Linea Testnet. To learn more about the various products we have, please visit [here](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to perform the basic functions of providing liquidity on PancakeSwap and how to trade tokens on PancakeSwap. In the future, we may add more functions than what is in the current phase of testnet. Please keep your eyes peeled for more!

## Add liquidity

1. Open a new tab and type in [pancakeswap.finance](https://pancakeswap.finance/) (or click this link), and select the Linea network in your MetaMask wallet.

4. For the first task, you need to add ETH-USDC liquidity into PancakeSwap v3. As a liquidity provider, you will be able to earn trading fees anytime a trade involving ETH-USDC occurs on PancakeSwap. Click ""Add liquidity"

5. Enter the amount of USDC and ETH you want to use for each token. For the testnet quest, please add the liquidity you provide on v3’s 0.25% fee tier. Once you are happy with your settings, click "Add" to provide the liquidity. You will need to confirm your transaction on Metamask.
