# Bridge your funds

In order to transact on Linea, you'll need to bridge Goerli ETH from Goerli to Linea.

You can find examples of how to bridge other tokens such as BNB and MATIC by exploring some of our partner bridges under the [explore section](/use-mainnet/explore). You can find the token contract addresses and their bridges [here](/use-mainnet/info-contracts#token-contract-addresses-and-bridges).

Before you begin, ensure you've:

1. [Set up your wallet](/use-mainnet/set-up-your-wallet)
1. [Funded your wallet with goerli ETH](/use-mainnet/fund)
