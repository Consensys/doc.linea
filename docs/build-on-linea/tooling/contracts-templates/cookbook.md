[Cookbook.dev](https://www.cookbook.dev/) is an open-source smart contract registry where developers can find solidity primitives, libraries, and smart contracts for protocols.


## Search Cookbook's Smart Contract Registry

Navigate to [cookbook.dev/chains/Linea](https://www.cookbook.dev/chains/Linea) and explore **Protocols** on Linea, or search for specific smart contracts in the search bar.

      alt="Cookbook Search"
    />
  </div>
</div>

To learn about a smart contract on Cookbook, select the protocol, and select `Expand`. This opens the code alongside ChefGPT, Cookbook's AI Solidity assistant. 

Highlight selections of the code and press **Analyze Snippet** to get more information about the smart contract code you're looking at, or ask ChefGPT questions about Linea, solidity, or your smart contract.

## Import any Smart Contract Code into Cookbook

Import verified smart contract code into Cookbook to fork, learn about, or build with by inputting any smart contract address into the Cookbook search bar.

## Find Smart Contracts within the Remix IDE with the Cookbook Plug-in
Go to [Remix.Ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/#activate=cookbookdev)

Add The Cookbook Plugin to Remix by clicking the Chef Hat Logo under **Featured Plugins** on the Remix Homepage.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
      <img
      src="/img/article_images/Build_on_Linea/Quickstart/Deploy_a_smart_contract/Cookbook/Linea_deploy_smart_contract_Cookbook_8.png"
      alt="Cookbook Remix Featured Plugin"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Alternatively, search Cookbook and select **Activate** in the Remix Plugin Manager. 

<div class="center-container">

      alt="Cookbook Remix Add Plugin"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Search for any protocol or smart contract and click the search result to import the smart contract code into Remix.

Cookbook's AI solidity co-pilot, ChefGPT, is available within the Remix plugin to answer questions about Linea, Solidity, or the smart contract you're working with.
