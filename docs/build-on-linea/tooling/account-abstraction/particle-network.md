## Smart Wallet-as-a-Service on Linea

[Particle Network](https://particle.network)'s Wallet Abstraction services enable universal, Web2-adjacent onboarding and interactions. Its core technology, [Smart Wallet-as-a-Service](https://blog.particle.network/announcing-our-smart-wallet-as-a-service-modular-stack-upgrading-waas-with-erc-4337) (WaaS) aims to onboard users into MPC-secured smart accounts supporting any chain. It also allows developers to offer an improved user experience through modular, fully customizable EOA/AA embedded wallets. Particle supports its Smart Wallet-as-a-Service through a Modular L1 powering chain abstraction, acting as a settlement layer across chains for a seamless multi-chain experience.

Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service is compatible with Linea through both usage of EOAs (traditional accounts) and AA (smart accounts). This AA support extends to Particle Network's [in-house Bundler](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction/rpc/bundler-rpc) and [Omnichain Paymaster](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction/paymaster) infrastructure, both of which are compatible with Linea.

Thus, developers can leverage Particle Network to onboard users into smart accounts using social login, then facilitate full-stack ERC-4337 account abstraction through it's [native AA SDKs](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction/sdks), available across six platforms.
