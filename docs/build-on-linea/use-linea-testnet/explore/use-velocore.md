In this simple guide, we’ll gladly walk you through how to swap and add liquidity to complete Voyage Quest!

### Voyage Quest - "Swap and provide liquidity with any tokens"

## Preparing your wallet for the Linea Testnet

If you don't have any tokens in your wallet yet, you have two options:

1.  Our partner Fluvi wallet offers [one-click Faucets and sponsored transactions](https://linea-quest.fluvi.io) to support your completion of Voyage quests. Simply connect your wallet and proceed with the tasks.
2.  Or go to the [Linea Faucet Site](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build) and verify for testnet tokens

Make sure to turn on “show/hide test network” option on Metamask and connect to the Linea Goerli Testnet
