# Hop

[Hop](https://docs.hop.exchange/) is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge. It allows users to send tokens from one rollup to another almost immediately without having to wait for the rollup’s challenge period.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to bridge Goerli ETH using Hop over to Linea!

Before you begin, ensure your wallet is:

1. [Configured to use Linea](/use-mainnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx).
1. [Funded with Goerli ETH](/build-on-linea/use-linea-testnet/fund.md#get-test-eth-on-goerli)

## Bridge Goerli ETH to Linea

To bridge Goerli ETH to Linea, you'll need to:

1. Navigate to the [Hop bridge](https://goerli.hop.exchange/#/send?token=ETH&sourceNetwork=ethereum&destNetwork=linea)
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet
1. Switch network to Goerli
1. Ensure that Goerli is the From network and Linea is the To network
