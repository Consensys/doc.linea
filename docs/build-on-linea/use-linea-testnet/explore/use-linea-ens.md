# Linea ENS

Linea ENS has been developed by Consensys to showcase how Linea can be used to manage ENS subdomain on L2, where users can benefit from cheaper gas fees. Technically, this is made possible thanks to ENSIP10 described [here](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-10-wildcard-resolution).

## How to register a Linea ENS domain

1. Navigate to [Linea ENS website](https://ens.goerli.linea.build/)
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet.

5. Make sure the domain is available, and click the register button. Please note: all the domains end with .linea-build.eth! So a name could be for example: example.linea-build.eth.
