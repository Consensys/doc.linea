## Linea Alpha v0.2.3 (June 22, 2023)

### Summary

This release focuses on optimizing the prover's hashing strategy to increase its computational efficiency.

## Linea Alpha v0.2.2 (June 20, 2023)

### Summary

This release focuses on updating the Postman SDK configuration values and revising gas fee calculations.

### Features

- Updated the Postman SDK configuration files to handle messages that are contract calls with zero ETH value being transferred and revised gas fee calculations.

## Linea Alpha v0.2.1 (June 15, 2023)

### Summary

This release reduces the gas cost of submitting a batch of transactions on L1 by optimizing optimizing L2 logs in the calldata that is sent to L1.

### Features

- Instead of sending the entire event MessageSent, we only send the \_messageHash field of the event.

- **Old calldata for L2 originated event**:

  ```bash
  //		event MessageSent(
  //			address indexed _from,
  //			address indexed _to,
  //			uint256 _fee,
  //			uint256 _value,
  //			uint256 _salt,
  //			bytes _calldata,
  //			bytes32 _messageHash
  //	    );
  ```

- **New calldata for L2 originated event**:
  ```bash
    //			bytes32 _messageHash
  ```

## Linea Alpha v0.2.0 (June 13, 2023)

### Summary

This release focuses on testing a substantial architecture upgrade in preparation for Mainnet launch. It contains multiple improvements and breaking changes, specifically around the messaging layer which is changed to a push model. It also improves EVM prover coverage, and provides batch conflation.

### Features

- Add Batch Conflation feature to the sequencer to minimize L1 transactions cost.
  - With Batch Conflation, L2 blocks' proofs that should have been independent are instead merged together. Therefore, L1 costs for these blocks’ proofs are divided by the number of merged blocks.
- Improve the following smart contracts:
  - Rollup zkEVM: Upgrade the rollup main contract with support for
    - Conflation
    - Security Council management
    - Verifier
      - Outer proof system moved from Groth16 to Plonk + custom gates to support efficient Fiat Shamir, c.f.: https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1072.pdf section 6.2
    - Messaging Service
      - Changed the message service model by splitting the delivery into anchoring and claiming of messages to allow more flexible workflows, remove the mandatory fee for L1→L2, reduce the mandatory fee for L2→L1
  - Canonical Token Bridge: Upgrade from 1-1 ERC20 basic token bridge to N-N ERC20 canonical token bridge with reservation and token registry
- Add Postman Service for message execution
  - The Postman Service is Linea’s off-chain message delivery service. It’s decentralized, permissionless, and used to claim messages once the protocol has anchored the message hashes. The first release will only contain the following scenarios:
    - DApps/protocols operating the SDK (to be released) claiming messages and paying for gas
      - The protocol can filter messages based on origin or destination smart-contracts
    - Linea operating the SDK for dApps/Protocols that aren’t yet integrated
  - If messages don’t get delivered by the postman, the message can be manually claimed by calling `claimMessage` with the `MessageSent` event parameters or by using the SDK.
- Update prover to integrate with the new architecture and support Batch Conflation

### Breaking changes

**Message bridge**

- Bridging partners will need to listen to different events. Modifications to the events are seen below:

  <table>

        </td>

          block finalization.

        </td>
        <td>
          L1→L2 message hash has been anchored on L2 and can be claimed on block
          finalization.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

- The anchoring and execution (claim) process has been separated into 2 steps. The deadline concept has been completely removed.

Contracts audit is in progress. This does not reflect final versions.

- **L1 (Goerli)**:

  - Bridging partners, to send messages, will need to call the new contract address with a different ABI.
