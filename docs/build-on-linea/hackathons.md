## Monthly mini-hack

Every month, Linea hosts a mini-hack to celebrate continuous building! No need to start from scratch - the only requirement is that you're building with Linea, you've had at least one Github commit in the current month, and you've made some noise about it in public!

Things to note:
- You can submit on behalf on a formal organization (profit-seeking company), but priority will be given to independent hackers
- You can make multiple submissions
- You can use an old project and refresh it!
- If you're in the Linea Builders Club, you can apply for both the public and private tracks!

This month, we're distributing a $1000 pool prize amongst Linea Builders Club members and the wider public.

**Due: March 31st, 2024**

**Public track: Create frog-themed developer content on Linea**

Guides, walkthroughs, tutorials, videos - developer content is the backbone of what brings builders on chain! This month's mini-hack centers on _learning in public_, focused on practical educational content to teach early developers how to build use-case oriented sample dapps on Linea.

_Requirements_
- Open-source Github repo
- Link to a deployed contract on goerli.lineascan.build or lineascan.build
- A blog post walking through step-by-step how you built your dapp and how to deploy on Linea testnet
- Posting the blog post and tagging @lineabuild on X and @linea on Farcaster
- A frog is somewhere in your submission
- At least one commit in the month of March

_Bonus points_
- Incorporating [partner tooling](https://docs.linea.build/build-on-linea/tooling) to make more robust and interesting examples
- Filming a video walkthrough or explainer of your content

_Judging criteria_
- How easy is the tutorial to follow

**Private Linea Builders Club track: Build a killer UI**

All you need to do is build cool sh*t on Linea and make it easy to use.

_Requirements_
- Open-source Github repo
- Link to a deployed contract on goerli.lineascan.build or lineascan.build
- Posting a working demo and tagging @lineabuild on X and @linea on Farcaster
- A short video explaining what and how you built
- At least one commit in the month of March

_Bonus points_
- Incorporating [partner tooling](https://docs.linea.build/build-on-linea/tooling) to make more robust and interesting examples
- A frog is somewhere in your submission

_Judging criteria_
- UX/UI
- Utility
