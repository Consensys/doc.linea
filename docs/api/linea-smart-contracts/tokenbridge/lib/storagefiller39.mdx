# `StorageFiller39`

Contract used to reserve storage slots in the TokenBridge contract. This helps maintain storage layout compatibility during upgrades.

The StorageFiller39 reserves 39 storage slots that can be used in future upgrades without changing the storage layout of existing variables.

```solidity
contract StorageFiller39 {
    // Reserved storage slots
    uint256[39] private __gap;
}
```

This pattern is commonly used in upgradeable contracts to ensure that new variables can be added in future versions without causing storage collisions.
