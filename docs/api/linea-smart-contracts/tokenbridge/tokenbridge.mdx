### bridgeToken

```solidity
function bridgeToken(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _recipient) public payable
```

This function is the single entry point to bridge tokens to the
  other chain, both for native and already bridged tokens. You can use it
  to bridge any ERC20. If the token is bridged for the first time an ERC20
  (BridgedToken.sol) will be automatically deployed on the target chain.

_User should first allow the bridge to transfer tokens on his behalf.
  Alternatively, you can use BridgeTokenWithPermit to do so in a single
  transaction. If you want the transfer to be automatically executed on the
  destination chain. You should send enough ETH to pay the postman fees.
  Note that Linea can reserve some tokens (which use a dedicated bridge).
  In this case, the token cannot be bridged. Linea can only reserve tokens
  that have not been bridged yet.
  Linea can pause the bridge for security reason. In this case new bridge
  transaction would revert.
Note: If, when bridging an unbridged token and decimals are unknown,
the call will revert to prevent mismatched decimals. Only those ERC20s,
with a decimals function are supported._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _token | address | The address of the token to be bridged. |
| _amount | uint256 | The amount of the token to be bridged. |
| _recipient | address | The address that will receive the tokens on the other chain. |

### bridgeTokenWithPermit

```solidity
function bridgeTokenWithPermit(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _recipient, bytes _permitData) external payable
```

Similar to `bridgeToken` function but allows to pass additional
  permit data to do the ERC20 approval in a single transaction.
_permit can fail silently, don't rely on this function passing as a form
  of authentication

_There is no need for validation at this level as the validation on pausing,
and empty values exists on the "bridgeToken" call._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _token | address | The address of the token to be bridged. |
| _amount | uint256 | The amount of the token to be bridged. |
| _recipient | address | The address that will receive the tokens on the other chain. |
| _permitData | bytes | The permit data for the token, if applicable. |

### completeBridging

```solidity
function completeBridging(address _nativeToken, uint256 _amount, address _recipient, uint256 _chainId, bytes _tokenMetadata) external
```

_It can only be called from the Message Service. To finalize the bridging
  process, a user or postman needs to use the `claimMessage` function of the
  Message Service to trigger the transaction._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _nativeToken | address | The address of the token on its native chain. |
| _amount | uint256 | The amount of the token to be received. |
| _recipient | address | The address that will receive the tokens. |
