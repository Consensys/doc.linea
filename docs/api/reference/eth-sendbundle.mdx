:::

Privately sends a bundle of signed transactions to be executed atomically, allowing the intended 
transaction to be "sandwiched" between others, enabling services such as:
- Frontrunning protection
- Gas abstraction
- Revert protection

## Parameters

- `txs`: An array of signed transactions to execute in the bundle.
- `blockNumber`: Hexadecimal block number for the block the bundle is valid in.

## Returns

- `bundleHash`: The hash of the executed bundle.

## Example
