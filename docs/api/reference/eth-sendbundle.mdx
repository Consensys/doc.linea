:::

Privately sends a bundle of signed transactions to be executed atomically, allowing the caller to 
define transaction execution order. This enables services such as:
- Frontrunning protection
- Gas abstraction
- Revert protection.

Due to being sent atomically, the bundle will only be executed if all transactions are confirmed.

The method can also improve UX, as users can review and approve a bundle of transactions with one 
click, rather than multiple clicks. (Assuming the dapp and wallet being used have implemented [EIP-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792), 
and the wallet supports `eth_sendBundle` on Linea.)

:::info

Methods for cancelling the bundle (`eth_cancelBundle`) or retrieving its status (`eth_getBundleStatus`) 
are not yet supported. To get the bundle status, we recommend wallets use `eth_getTransactionReceipt` 
on each transaction in the bundle. Dapps can fetch status by using the `wallet_getCallsStatus` 
method added in EIP-5792.

:::

## Parameters

- `txs`: An array of signed transactions to execute in the bundle.
- `blockNumber`: Hexadecimal block number for the block the bundle is valid in.

## Returns

- `bundleHash`: The hash of the executed bundle.
