not relevant for node operators.

:::

Sends a bundle of signed transactions to be executed atomically, allowing the intended transaction
to be "sandwiched" between others, enabling services such as:
- Frontrunning protection
- Gas abstraction
- Reversion protection
- Backrunning. 

## Parameters

- `txs`: An array of signed transactions to execute in the bundle.
- `blockNumber`: Hexadecimal block number for the block the bundle is valid in.

## Returns

- `bundleHash`: The hash of the executed bundle.

## Example
