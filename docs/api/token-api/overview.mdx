The Token API provides comprehensive programmatic access to token data on the Linea network. This 
API is designed for developers, builders and analysts who need detailed information about ERC-20 
tokens and their activity on Linea.

:::warning[Beta Version]
Linea's Token API is in beta version and subject to breaking changes. We recommend using it for 
testing and development purposes only. We welcome your feedback on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/linea)
in the [#developer-chat](https://discord.com/channels/1141419161893998702/1141419163223593024) channel.

## Key features

### Token data
- Complete list of available tokens on Linea
- Detailed token metadata (name, symbol, decimals, logo)
- Current and historical prices
- Trading statistics (buy/sell counts)
- Fairly diluted valuation

### Market analytics
- Most traded tokens in the last 24h
- Top movers, gainers and losers (price variation)
- Price movement tracking

### Use cases
- Token monitoring dashboards
- Onchain data analysis
- DeFi application integration
- Wallet and transaction tracking
- Filter by secure tokens
- Automated trading bots

## Data sources

Data is collected and updated from multiple sources:

### Primary sources
- Onchain data (smart contract states)
- [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)
- MetaMask Token & Price API
- [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/)
- [Nile](https://www.nile.build/)
- [Moralis](https://moralis.com/)

Please see the [Linea terms of use](https://linea.build/terms-of-service) about third party 
information.

### Update frequencies
- Token detection and metadata: every two hours
- Historical prices: hourly
- Current prices: every five minutes

## Usage examples

### Filter tokens by security

Getting a raw list of tokens is good, but getting a list of tokens that are secure is even better.
You can filter tokens according to their security status using the `isSecure` query parameter.

For a token to be considered as secure,
it must have a Moralis security score greater than 70 and a market capitalization greater than $50k.

```typescript
async function getSecureTokens() {
  const BASE_URL = "https://token-api.linea.build";
  const tokens = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/tokens?isSecure=true`).then(r => r.json());
  console.log('Secure tokens:', tokens);
}
```

### Get new gems

New gems are tokens that were recently deployed and may be the next big thing.
Adding an `isSecure` filter might be a good idea to avoid scams.

```typescript
async function getNewGems() {
  const BASE_URL = "https://token-api.linea.build";
  const tokens = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/tokens?order=createdAt&sort=desc`).then(r => r.json());
  console.log('Recent tokens:', tokens);
}
```

### Get most-swapped tokens

You can get the most-swapped tokens in the last 24 hours using the `isMostSwapped` query parameter.

:::warning[Deprecation notice]
This query will change at the end of the beta phase to an ordering method (ordering by `swaps`).
:::

```typescript
async function getMostSwapped() {
  const BASE_URL = "https://token-api.linea.build";
  const tokens = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/tokens?isMostSwapped=true`).then(r => r.json());
  console.log('Most swapped tokens:', tokens);
}
```

### Simple token price bot

```typescript
async function monitorPriceChange(contractAddress: string, threshold: number) {
  const BASE_URL = "https://token-api.linea.build";
  const { currentPrice: initialPrice } = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/tokens/${contractAddress}`).then(r => r.json());

  setInterval(async () => {
    const { currentPrice } = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/tokens/${contractAddress}`).then(r => r.json());
    const priceChange = (currentPrice - initialPrice) / initialPrice;

    if (Math.abs(priceChange) > threshold) {
      // Execute something, e.g. send a notification or trigger a trade
      console.log(`Price changed by ${priceChange}% - Trading signal`);
    }
  }, 60000); // Check every minute
}
```

## Best practices

1. **Rate limiting**
- Beta version has strict rate limits per IP:
  - Two requests per second
  - 60 requests per minute
- Cache static data
- Implement backoff strategies

2. **Error handling**
- Check HTTP status codes
- Implement retry with exponential backoff
- Validate token addresses

3. **Performance and security**
- Use pagination for large lists
- Use local caching when appropriate
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
