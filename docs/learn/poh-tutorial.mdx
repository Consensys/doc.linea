Proof of Humanity (PoH) lets you verify whether a wallet belongs to a real human on Linea. It
provides a simple and reliable way for projects to gate access to rewards or features exclusively for
verified users.

PoH V2 is powered by a single attestation issued by Sumsub through the Verax Attestation Registry.
This version replaces the (too) complex multi-provider setup that was used for PoH V1, simplifying
verification to a single, trusted data source.

## The Sybil problem

In Web3, identity is fluid, meaning users can create as many wallets as they want. This openness
fuels innovation but also creates opportunities for abuse. A Sybil attack occurs when one actor
generates multiple fake identities to exploit a system designed for fair participation.

Common examples include:

- Airdrop farming, where a single individual controls thousands of wallets to claim rewards.
- Fake voting in DAOs or community governance, undermining collective decisions.
- Spam campaigns that flood onchain communities or social apps.
- Automated account creation to game loyalty programs or incentive systems.

Recent data shows how widespread this problem has become. Nansen and other web3 analytics firms
have revealed that a significant share of wallet activity in certain programs comes from non-human
or clustered entities. For instance, several major projects recently had to filter tens of millions
of wallets to preserve fairness in their distributions (e.g. Linea had to filter more than half a
million wallets to preserve our TGE from farmers).

The takeaway is clear: without human verification, decentralized systems remain vulnerable. Linea's
Proof of Humanity V2 addresses this by providing developers a reliable way to ensure "one human,
one action."

## Why verifying users matters

Verifying users isn't about restricting access - it's about building integrity into digital
communities and economies.

For developers, it means:

- Preventing fraud and abuse by excluding automated or duplicate accounts. Bots inflate all your
  metrics, giving you misleading data about your app growth and you end up optimizing for noise, not
  real adoption.
- Protecting incentive systems like governance tokens, loyalty points, or rewards programs. Bots can
  quickly drain incentives systems without adding value, PoH helps you target your spending to real
  users only.
- Reducing moderation costs by ensuring real humans drive community engagement.

For users, it builds:

- Trust and fairness, knowing that everyone participates on equal footing.
- Safety, by reducing exposure to spam, scams, or bots.
- Reputation portability, since a verified identity can be reused across multiple dapps within the
  Linea ecosystem.

Verification also enables new categories of applications — from proof-of-personhood voting to
verified social reputation, identity-based access control, or even credit scoring.

## Unlocking growth through verification

Human verification isn't just a security measure — it's a growth accelerator.

When users trust that interactions are genuine, engagement and retention improve. Developers can
focus on building features instead of moderating spam or chasing fraudulent claims. Communities
become healthier, and token incentives circulate among real participants.

With PoH V2, Linea dapps can:

- Simplify onboarding with a single verification flow across the ecosystem.
- Enhance brand credibility by signaling transparency and integrity.
- Foster sustainable ecosystems, where every wallet represents a verified human being. This will
  fuel every human-to-human interaction, knowing bots won't have a seat at the table.

Trust, in this context, becomes a competitive advantage, and a key differentiator for web3
applications aiming to scale responsibly.

## Verify: how users complete their Proof of Humanity

You can integrate Proof of Humanity in your app to restrict access, rewards or actions to real users
only. Use the **Sumsub Proof of Personhood flow** to allow users to verify their humanity directly
from your app. This flow handles user verification through **Sumsub's Proof of Personhood** flow and
issues a **Verax attestation** onchain.

:::tip Before you start
You'll need:

- A frontend app connected to the Linea network
- A reliable Linea Mainnet RPC provider such as [Infura](https://developer.metamask.io)
- A way to read the user's wallet address (e.g. [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useAccount))

## Ensuring security and reliability

Proof of Humanity V2 is built with robust security, privacy, and transparency in mind.

- Trusted verification: All attestations are issued by Sumsub, a regulated KYC provider with
  industry-standard compliance.
- Onchain transparency: Every verification is recorded through the Verax Attestation Registry,
  ensuring public verifiability.
- User privacy: Only the attestation (not personal data) is stored onchain — maintaining a balance
  between identity assurance and privacy.
- System reliability: The PoH API handles rate limits, temporary downtimes, and blockchain
  propagation gracefully, ensuring developers always receive accurate verification states.

Developers can confidently integrate PoH knowing it provides a secure, composable, and future-proof
foundation for identity-driven experiences.

### A note on privacy

When users complete the verification flow, Sumsub processes a face-video and biometric images to
check for liveness and identity-document match, but they only stores a hash, they do not store the
full image.

Sumsub adheres to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles (lawful, transparent,
purpose-limited, minimal, secure), and implements ISO/IEC 27001/27017/27018, SOC 2 Type 2 and
PCI-DSS security frameworks, giving users the best standards for data protection and privacy.

For our most privacy savvy users, we're working on a privacy-preserving verification alternative that
will give you further control while still ensuring "one-human-one-wallet" trust.

## Conclusion

Proof of Humanity V2 is a true enable of growth for all builders and dapps on the Linea ecosystem.
By giving dapps the ability to verify real humans, easily, securely, and onchain, it helps transform
the way web3 applications grow and interact with their communities.

If you're building on Linea, PoH V2 is now live and available through our developer documentation.
