# Use ReadON on Linea

# ReadON

> ReadON is a Web2-compatible content service layer that solves the problem of centralized content platforms monopolizing creators' work and user data. It offers ownership solutions, curation consensus data, and privacy protection services based on a decentralized content consensus design and ZK protocol. With a strong community consensus, ReadON has become a leading Web3 content index.

As users progress and gain experience, their ReadON profile evolves, reflecting their growth and expertise. It becomes a key to unlocking governance rights within their respective domains. With these rights, users shape the content landscape, influencing curation decisions, determining the weight of their comments, and having a say on the quality of content. They become pioneers in their fields, actively participating in the genesis voting of new topic communities and driving meaningful discussions.

**Minting a ReadON Linea Profile is more than just creating an identity token; it's an invitation to explore and contribute to the dynamic Linea world. It's an opportunity to be part of a thriving ecosystem where knowledge is shared, expertise is celebrated, and new possibilities constantly unfold.**
