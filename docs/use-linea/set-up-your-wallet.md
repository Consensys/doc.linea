Linea is designed to be completely compatible with Ethereum. Because of that, **it works with MetaMask right out of the box**. (If you're not familiar with the identity manager, wallet, and web3 passport that is MetaMask, [get started here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531)).

In fact, **the MetaMask extension wallet provides connections to the Linea testnet already built-in**. There's no special wallet setup necessary! The only thing you'll need to do is switch to Linea; if you need some pointers, follow [MetaMask's instructions here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/16367251716251).

All you need to interact with Linea is to download MetaMask, which you can [install as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/).

## Using Linea on MetaMask Extension

Because Linea is currently only in public testnet, in MetaMask Extension, you'll need to click on `Show/hide test networks` to have it displayed, as indicated in the image below. Afterwards, select the Linea network, and you're good to go.

## Using Linea on MetaMask Mobile

Linea is **included in the available networks in MetaMask Mobile by default**. 💖🦊🚀

## Other wallets

Linea is compatible with any EVM-compatible wallet. If you want to add the Linea network, you can find the relevant network information under [Network information and deployed contracts](../developers/useful-info.md#network-information).

### OK, so I've got Linea in MetaMask. What now?

**MetaMask is like a Swiss Army Knife**: no matter what you need to do in the decentralized web, it's probably got a tool for it.

That's a good thing, too, because of the **ever-growing number of dapps available on the network**. Check out [the Ecosystem Portal](https://goerli.linea.build/explore) to see if your favorite web3 dapp is already here.

If you're a developer, check out using [Truffle's Dashboard](https://trufflesuite.com/blog/introducing-truffle-dashboard/) to keep your private keys safe while you [deploy a contract to Linea](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/deploy-smart-contract/truffle) (perhaps [an ERC-721?](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/deploy-an-erc-721-contract-on-linea-using-infura-and-truffle-27e5c15c401f))

Regardless of what you're doing on Linea, you'll likely need some tokens in order to transact.

### Getting tokens on Linea

There are several ways to get tokens on Linea: **through a faucet, from a friend** (or a fren), or **by bridging it**. Here are some resources to get you started:

### Faucets

Because Linea is still a testnet, there are a number of faucets that you can use.

> Linea is currently a testnet; it's is also a _rollup_. That means that if it were a live network, and not a testnet, it would be rolling up all its activity to Ethereum. Instead, it's rolling up to Goerli Testnet. This means that the ETH on Linea is based on Goerli ETH.
>
> So if you want to bridge ETH, you'll need to bridge **from Goerli to Linea**, not from Ethereum Mainnet.

There are a number of faucets available, including [Infura's](https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea); for a fuller explanation, follow [our guide here](https://docs.linea.build/use-linea/fund).

### Getting tokens from a fren

Do you know someone who's a Linea 🐳?

Maybe they'd be willing to send you some test ETH. Grab [your account's public address](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289512), and have [them send you some](./use-linea/transfer-funds).

### Bridge your own

If you've got some Goerli ETH, or want to [swap for some](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415426473499-Third-party-swaps-platforms), then you'll be able to bridge that Goerli ETH up to Linea using the [bridge process outlined here](./use-linea/bridge-funds).

## Is it a MetaMask problem, or a network problem, or dapp problem?

If you're having technical difficulties, it can sometimes be hard to figure out where the problem is. The good news is, there's a lot of good support available to you in our ecosystem.

If you're interacting with a dapp on Linea, try that dapp's documentation and resources first. If you can't find your answer there, take a look at the [Linea Support Help Center](https://support.linea.build), and search on the [Linea Community Forums](https://community.linea.build) for related issues. If it seems like a MetaMask issue at that point, jump over to [MetaMask's Help Center](https://support.metamask.io), where you can explore their forums, and start a conversation with Support staff.
