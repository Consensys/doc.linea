The MetaMask extension wallet provides a default Linea network. There's no special wallet setup necessary! All you need to interact with Linea is to download MetaMask, which you can [install as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/).

Because Linea is currently only in public testnet, you'll need to click on `Show/hide test networks` to have it displayed. Afterwards, select the Linea network, and you're good to go!

## Using Linea on MetaMask mobile

The MetaMask mobile wallet also provides a default Linea network. In order to display it, you'll need to enable `Show/hide test networks` on your mobile app.

## Other wallets

Linea is compatible with any EVM-compatible wallet. If you want to add the Linea network, you can find the relevant network information under [Network information and deployed contracts](../reference/useful-info.md#network-information).
