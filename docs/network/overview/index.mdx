Linea is a secure, low-cost, and Ethereum-equivalent layer 2 blockchain built to bring the world 
onchain without compromising on security and decentralization. 

Linea has been incubated within Consensys. Our mission is to empower developers to build the next generation of decentralized applications and onboard the next billion users to web3. 

## Security for all

Built as a layer above Ethereum, Linea inherits the robust security and decentralization of the 
Ethereum network while significantly increasing throughput and reducing transaction fees to 
negligible amounts. 

→ Learn about [Linea's architecture](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx)

## Advanced zero-knowledge proof technology

By leveraging zero-knowledge (zk) proofs, Linea removes the seven-day lockup period associated with 
fraud proofs in other layer 2 solutions built according to the optimistic rollup model. Using zk
proofs ensures user funds are always available and can be withdrawn instantly and at no cost.

→ Learn about how proofs fit within [Linea's transaction lifecycle](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx#transaction-lifecycle)

## True Ethereum equivalence

Linea supports all the features that Ethereum supports. It's the only zero-knowledge layer 2 network 
fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that any Ethereum-based 
projects and assets can be seamlessly deployed on and bridged to Linea without any code base 
changes. 

→ Learn about the small differences between building on [Ethereum and Linea](./ethereum-differences.mdx)

## Fast finality

Soft finality within 2s thanks to Linea's short block time and lack of reorgs.

→ Learn about Linea's [finality lifecycle](./known-finality-state.mdx)

## Predictable pricing

Clarity over Linea prices for transactions, how to estimate fees, and how Layer 1 and Layer 2 costs are accounted for.

→ Learn about Linea's [pricing strategy](./predictable-pricing.mdx)

## Recoverable state

Dedicated plugin to reconstruct Linea's state as it was at the last point in time data was finalized.

→ Learn about [recovering state](./recoverable-state.mdx)

## Scale with MetaMask 

Linea is the best way for application developers to leverage MetaMask's products and distribution. 
Seamlessly integrate Linea through the MetaMask Developer portal, unlock easy on-ramping, bridging 
and swaps for your users, and access millions of the most engaged onchain users worldwide.
