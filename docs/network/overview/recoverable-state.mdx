Linea supports the possibility to reconstruct the state.

## Recover state from a finalized block

In the highly unlikely event that Linea's sequencer fails, it must be possible to reconstruct
Linea's state as it was at the last point in time data was finalized, using the finality data. Conceivably,
any entity could then resume transaction sequencing, confident that state was resuming from the 
correct point. 

State recovery insures against the risks of a single point of failure that could cripple the network.
Since this system can be used by any independent actor to validate state roots against L1-published
data, it also reduces the need for trust in the Linea
[sequencer and coordinator](../../protocol/architecture/index.mdx).

## There's a plugin for that

To support state recovery, the Linea Besu execution client has a recovery plugin that:

1. Retrieves finalized blobs from L1; 
2. Decompresses the blob data;
3. Replays the transactions in the execution client, and, finally,
4. Checks that the resulting `stateRootHash` matches the one finalized on L1. 

Linea Besu executes the fetched transactions in the blob, while the state management plugin, Shomei, 
rebuilds state.
