Use this feature page to understand how Linea prices transactions, how to estimate fees, and how
Layer 1 and Layer 2 costs are accounted for.

## How gas works on Linea

Linea supports the
[Ethereum EIP-1559 gas price model](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/gas):

```
total fee = units of gas used * (base fee + priority fee)
```

It includes support for type 0, type 1, and type 2 transactions.

Linea is EVM-equivalent, and gas works similarly to Ethereum. The main
difference is that the base fee effectively stabilizes at 7 wei. Linea blocks use up to around 50%
of the maximum block size of 2 billion gas, and the base fee decreases or increases by 12.5% per
block according to network traffic, identically to Ethereum. However, when the base fee reaches
7 wei, 12.5% is less than 1 wei, and the reduction is rounded down to zero; so the fee remains
7 wei. The base fee is also burned, like on Ethereum.

The gas cost to submit your transaction and include it on Ethereum involves the following fee
components:

- **Layer 2 cost**: The execution fee; the cost of including your transaction on the Linea
  sequencer, and calculated using a similar formula to Ethereum (as described above)
- **Layer 1 cost**: The cost of publishing your L2 transaction on Ethereum, which varies based on
  the blob fee market

These two resource costs are abstracted by the rollup and covered by the recommended L2 gas price
and gas used.

### Supported JSON-RPC calls:
