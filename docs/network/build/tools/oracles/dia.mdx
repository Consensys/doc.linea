## Querying DIA price feeds

:::note
This is a demo oracle which is not intended for use in production
environments. Interested in a production-ready oracle?
[Contact the DIA team](https://t.me/DIAOracles_Support_Bot). 
:::

Call the `getValue(string memory key)` function on the oracle contract with the
Query Symbol (e.g., "BTC/USD"). The function returns the asset price with 8
decimal precision and the timestamp of the last update. We'll use this address
on Linea Sepolia:
[`0x533d3c1df8d238374065fb3341c34754e4bfce8e`](https://sepolia.lineascan.build/address/0x533d3c1df8d238374065fb3341c34754e4bfce8e).

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
interface IDIAOracleV2 {
    function getValue(string memory) external view returns (uint128,
             uint128);
}
contract DIAOracleSample {
    /**
    * @notice The DIA oracle to read from.
    * Oracle Address: 0x533d3c1df8d238374065fb3341c34754e4bfce8e
    * Network: Linea Sepolia
    */
    address constant diaOracle = "0x...";
    function getPrice(string memory key)
    external
    view
    returns (
        uint128 latestPrice,
        uint128 timestampOfLatestPrice
    ) {
        (latestPrice, timestampOfLatestPrice) =
                 IDIAOracleV2(diaOracle).getValue(key);
    }
}
```
