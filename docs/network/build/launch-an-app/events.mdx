# Publish an event for your app

In addition to [listing your app](./hub.mdx), you can also create events for your app.

To do so, head to the Linea Developer Hub, find the "Events" section in the sidebar, and click the
"Create event" button.

An event page helps drive excitement and participation by showcasing engaging, time-limited 
experiences in your app. Events are displayed directly on your app page, increasing visibility and 
conversion by giving users a reason to engage with your app while the event is live.

To create the best possible event, follow our guidance for submitting each of the following elements:

### Name

Choose a clear, unique name under 30 characters that captures the essence of your event. Use title 
case for consistency across events.

### Tagline

Add a short tagline that communicates what makes your event unique and worth joining.

### Banner

Use a high-quality image that is visually distinct from your app banner to avoid confusion and 
signal that this is a specific event. Avoid adding text: your event's name and tagline already 
appear above it. As with your app banner, avoid light background colors, and keep important visual 
elements in the top-right section to avoid cropping.

### Event button

Ensure the link behind your event's "View" button takes users directly into the event within your app.
This minimizes friction and gets them to the experience quickly. Avoid directing users to another 
event page in your app that repeats the same thing.

### Overview

Craft a clear, engaging paragraph outlining what users will experience, followed by a short list of 
key activities, challenges, or rewards that will excite your audience.

### Availability

Clearly specify your event's start and end dates, and promote it up to 14 days in advance to 
maximize interest and visibility.

### Category

Choose the appropriate event category to help users quickly understand the nature of your event.

### Performance tracking

Use analytics in your Developer Hub to monitor impressions, views, and user engagement with your 
event. Analyze these insights to refine and improve your future event strategies.

### Promotion

Promote your event on your social media channels and within your app. Always link directly to your 
Linea Hub event page; this helps users trust the event. It shows the event is officially listed and 
verified within the Linea ecosystem, which signals it's real and safe.
