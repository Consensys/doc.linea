The Linea team operates a UI for the [official Linea bridge](https://linea.build/hub/bridge/).

The canonical token bridge is optimized for technical partners who are deploying on Linea. 
We recommend that everyday users of Linea seeking to bridge their personal tokens between 
networks leverage one of the many bridges deployed to the network.

Linea seeks to foster a permissionless, resilient, decentralized environment — not to have our 
bridge be a centralized arbiter and point of failure.

## How to bridge

### Workflow

1. Triggering the transfer

- **Without Permit**
  - User should first allow the bridge to transfer tokens on their behalf
  - This is done by calling `allowance()` on the TokenBridge.
  - Then, the user should call the `bridgeToken()` method.
- **With Permit**
  - User can call `bridgeTokenWithPermit()` to pass permit data in a single transaction

2. Triggering the delivery

- See the
  [message service workflow](../../protocol/architecture/interoperability/message-service/reference.mdx#usage).
