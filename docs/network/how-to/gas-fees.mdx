`linea_estimateGas` is the recommended method for estimating gas price and gas limit on Linea. Unlike other L2s, Linea does _not_ assume that all transactions will have the same gas price. Instead, a minimum gas price is applied to all transactions, and the total gas price is partly calculated based on the amount of data in a given transaction. `linea_estimateGas` takes this into account, and returns a more accurate gas price recommendation than the alternatives.

See our [API reference](../../api/reference/linea-estimategas.mdx), or our
[predictable pricing feature](../features/predictable-pricing.mdx) for more information about how gas
works on Linea. 

Linea also supports:
- [`eth_estimateGas`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_estimategas)
- [`eth_gasPrice`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_gasprice)
- [`eth_feeHistory`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_feehistory).

:::tip
Linea supports the [Ethereum EIP-1559 gas price model](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/gas):
```
total fee = units of gas used * (base fee + priority fee)
```
and includes support for type 0, type 1 and type 2 transactions.

## [`linea_estimateGas`](../../api/reference/linea-estimategas.mdx)

`linea_estimateGas` returns `gasLimit`, 
`baseFeePerGas`, and `priorityFeePerGas`, and therefore provides a more precise recommended gas price than 
the alternatives.

It can also help prevent transactions from being rejected due to exceeding [module limits](../../protocol/architecture/prover/prover-limits.mdx).
