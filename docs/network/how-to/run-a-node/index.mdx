Linea follows Ethereum’s dual-layer design. Every Linea node runs:
- Maru for consensus
- An execution layer client of your choice

The following table lists the clients covered in this guide, and whether they provide direct access
to Linea-specific features.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Runs Linea-specific features?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[Besu](./besu.mdx)</td>
      <td>An Java-based open-source Ethereum client that can be extended using plugins.</td>
      <td>❌</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Linea Besu](./linea-besu.mdx)</td>
      <td>Besu client with plugins that implement Linea-specific features, such as [API methods](../../../api/reference/index.mdx) and a [finalized](../finalized-block.mdx) tag.</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Geth](./geth.mdx)</td>
      <td>The most widely used open-source Ethereum client, written in Go.</td>

## Docker Compose quickstart

Docker Compose is the recommended method to run a node. For binaries or build-from-source and client-specific instructions, see the
individual guides, or keep reading for a general guide.

Use Docker Compose as the default path. The canonical compose files live in the Linea monorepo:
- Mainnet: [`/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/blob/main/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/docker-compose.yml)
- Linea Sepolia: [`/docs/getting-started/linea-sepolia/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/blob/main/docs/getting-started/linea-sepolia/docker-compose.yml)

Quick steps:
1. Pick your network (mainnet or Linea Sepolia) and download the compose file above.
2. From that directory, run Docker Compose to start Maru plus your execution client.
3. For Linea-specific APIs such as `linea_estimateGas` and the `finalized` tag, use the Linea Besu
   compose example.

Next actions:
- Default compose examples: [Linea Besu](./linea-besu.mdx) and [Maru](./maru.mdx).
- Alternative EL clients: [Besu](./besu.mdx) or [Geth](./geth.mdx) to follow the chain.
- Upgrades: see [upgrade guides](./beta-v4-migration.mdx).
- Bootnodes: see [bootnodes](./bootnodes.mdx) if you need to override defaults.

## Canonical sources

- Compose files in the Linea monorepo (paths above) are the source of truth for images and versions.
- Linea Besu package compose profiles (`linea-besu-package/docker`) are for enabling Linea plugins;
  otherwise use the monorepo compose files.
- Local `/files` copies for other clients are historical; prefer the monorepo compose for current
  configuration.

## Alternative paths

Binaries or build-from-source are supported. Each client page documents its binary path as an
alternative if Docker Compose does not fit your environment.

There are no financial incentives for running a Linea node, and there is currently no option to vote
on blocks as part of the consensus mechanism or
[fork-choice](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/forkchoice/#whats-a-fork-choice) like on Ethereum.
