Linea follows Ethereum’s dual-layer design. Every Linea node runs:
- Maru for consensus
- An execution layer client (Linea Besu enables Linea-specific methods; other EL clients can follow the chain)

## Docker Compose quickstart

Use Docker Compose as the default path. The canonical compose files live in the Linea monorepo:
- Mainnet: [`/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/blob/main/docs/getting-started/linea-mainnet/docker-compose.yml)
- Linea Sepolia: [`/docs/getting-started/linea-sepolia/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/blob/main/docs/getting-started/linea-sepolia/docker-compose.yml)

Quick steps:
1. Pick your network (mainnet or Linea Sepolia) and download the compose file above.
2. From that directory, run Docker Compose to start Maru plus your execution client.
3. For Linea-specific APIs such as `linea_estimateGas` and the `finalized` tag, use the Linea Besu
   compose example.

Next actions:
- Default compose examples: [Linea Besu](./linea-besu.mdx) and [Maru](./maru.mdx).
- Alternative EL clients: [Besu](./besu.mdx) or [Geth](./geth.mdx) to follow the chain.
- Upgrades: see [upgrade guides](./beta-v4-migration.mdx).
- Bootnodes: see [bootnodes](./bootnodes.mdx) if you need to override defaults.

## Canonical sources

- Compose files in the Linea monorepo (paths above) are the source of truth for images and versions.
- Linea Besu package compose profiles (`linea-besu-package/docker`) are for enabling Linea plugins;
  otherwise use the monorepo compose files.
- Local `/files` copies for other clients are historical; prefer the monorepo compose for current
  configuration.

## Alternative paths

Binaries or build-from-source are supported. Each client page documents its binary path as an
alternative if Docker Compose does not fit your environment.

There are no financial incentives for running a Linea node, and there is currently no option to vote
on blocks as part of the consensus mechanism or
[fork-choice](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/forkchoice/#whats-a-fork-choice) like on Ethereum.
