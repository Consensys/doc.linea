Linea Surge is an LXP-driven program that rewards people for having assets on Linea and gives 
bonuses for deploying those assets into protocols.

The goal for The Surge is allow users that provide liquidity on the network to collect LXP-L. 
LXP-L is similar to the system we have in place today for [LXP](../linea-xp), but is collected by 
contributing liquidity to Linea. 

A core focus is on the expansion of available assets through new applications 
and DeFi use cases built on Linea. Additional liquidity brought by new applications sustainably 
supports additional volume, in turn impacting on the sustainability of the liquidity through 
increased fees for liquidity providers and increasing the percentage of ecosystem trading 
activity compared to other venues. This constitutes something of a flywheel network effect for 
the ecosystem.

The following sections provide further detail. In the overview page, we will explore the program,
before explaining the math behind it in _Point incentive design_.
