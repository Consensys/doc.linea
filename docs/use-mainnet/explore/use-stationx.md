# Explore StationX on Linea Testnet

StationX is a protocol that automates workflows using account abstraction for communities to manage money towards shared goals. The platform lets anyone spin up a Station in less than 60 seconds to distribute membership tokens/NFTs to contributors, manage assets together in a treasury & governance on a single dashboard. You can read more about it [here](https://stationx.network)

Before we get started, ensure your wallet is [configured to use Linea](https://docs.linea.build/use-linea-testnet/set-up-your-wallet). You need to have sufficient lineaETH (0.1 lineaETH recommended) to complete all steps, get lineaETH from [here](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/).

## Step 1: Create a Station

1. Go to [testnet.stationx.network](https://testnet.stationx.network), connect your wallet then click on ‘Manage Stations’ & click on the ‘**Create new’** button

1. Give a name & a token symbol for your Station. (For example, Degen club - DGC) and select the type of token you’d like to use for membership (ERC-20 / NFT)

1. Click ‘**Next’** & set deposit rules
1. If you had selected ERC20 token type, set min/max/total contribution per wallet, price per token & last date for contributors to deposit into your Station. _Tip: Keep min deposit amount low so that more people can easily join your Station since USDC per user is limited_

1. If you had selected NFT token type, set an art, price per NFT, max mint per wallet, total supply, etc. _Tip: Keep mint price low so that more people can easily join your Station since USDC per user is limited_

   ![Set nft rules](/img/quests/stationx/set_token_nft.png)

1. Click 'Next' to set Governance (Coming Soon), currently you can only create Stations with governance **disabled** on Linea.
