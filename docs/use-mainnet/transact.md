## Transfer tokens between accounts

You can use your MetaMask wallet to transfer tokens between accounts on the Linea network.

1. Open MetaMask and select **Linea Mainnet** or **Linea Goerli** from the network dropdown.
1. Select **Send**.
1. Type the address that you want to transfer funds to, or select **Transfer between my accounts** if the account belongs to your wallet.
1. Type the amount to transfer.
1. Select **Next** and **Confirm** to send the transaction.

You can now view the transaction details in the **Activity** tab or [block explorer](https://lineascan.build).

### Other wallets

Linea is a permissionless, EVM-compatible network. That means that if you want to use a different wallet with Linea, you might be able to, using the network information found under [Network info and deployed contracts](./info-contracts.md).
