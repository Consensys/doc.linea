## What is Linea Voyage XP?

Similar to video and role-playing games, wherein your character can gain Experience Points (XP) as
you go through the game, Linea Voyage LXP represents your journey and experience in the Linea
ecosystem.
The Voyage LXP tokens will be a custom
[ERC-20 token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), and will be
visible by default in your MetaMask wallet.

**Voyage LXP tokens are non-transferable, soulbound tokens that are distributed to recognize the
community's extraordinary contribution toward the growth of the Linea ecosystem. They do not have
any monetary value!**

Apart from being a measure of contribution to building Linea into a robust and secure L2 network,
Voyage LXP will also make owners eligible for benefits such as receiving official community roles,
exclusive Linea swag, and more!

:::note
Voyage LXP are non-transferable, and cannot be bridged to other networks. You cannot buy, sell, or
swap them, nor can you accumulate them by transferring LXP from another account.

However, you can use multiple accounts to earn LXP; more on that below.

Account binding allows you to aggregate your Voyage LXP tokens to a single primary account.
If you're navigating the Linea ecosystem with multiple accounts, choose one as your main hub to
effortlessly accumulate all the Voyage LXP you've received.
This ensures that every adventure is accurately recorded across your interconnected accounts,
providing a seamless and comprehensive representation of your Linea experience.

**Account binding is not retroactive. If you bind your account address after Voyage XP is received,
then those won't be linked to the primary account!**

:::caution

**Account binding is permanent and irreversible, so make sure you are choosing the correct account address when going through the process!**

- Using account binding is only necessary for those who want to bind two or more accounts.

- To receive LXP, the Primary account set must pass Proof of Humanity to receive LXP. Accounts set as secondary do not need to pass PoH.

- All LXP will be sent to your Primary account when using Account Binding

- You will receive LXP once per task. The exception to this is the Linea Voyage Testnet NFT, holders will receive LXP for each NFT owned.
