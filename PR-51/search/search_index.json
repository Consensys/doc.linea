You can also create new documentation sites . Your first contribution \u00b6 Start by choosing a documentation repository and looking for issues that have a Good First Issue label. Good First Issues might require only a few lines of documentation, or have enough information for a newcomer to easily document. When you\u2019ve identified an issue you want to work on, assign it to yourself, or message the ConsenSys team on that project\u2019s channel on Discord and a maintainer will assign it to you. Contribution workflow \u00b6 The documentation contribution workflow consists of forking repositories and submitting pull requests (PRs) using Git 1 . This facilitates social contribution, easy testing, and peer review. To contribute changes: Fork the documentation repository in which you want to make a change. Clone your fork to your computer. For repositories using the old system , add the --recursive option to retrieve the common submodule . git clone [ --recursive ] <FORKED-REPO> Add an upstream remote . git remote add upstream <ORIGINAL-REPO> Create and checkout a topic branch , naming it appropriately. We recommend using the issue number and short description, which is a reminder to fix only one issue in a PR. For example, 183-doc-cli-option . git checkout -b <ISSUE-NUM>-<ISSUE-DESC> Open the documentation repository in a text editor of your choice, for example IntelliJ , and make your changes. Refer to the documentation style guide and the MkDocs and Markdown guide when making documentation changes. Preview your changes with MkDocs to check that the changes render correctly. Add and commit your changes, using a clear commit message. Push your changes to your remote fork (usually named origin ). git add * git commit -m \"<COMMIT-MESSAGE>\" git push origin Navigate to the original ConsenSys documentation repository, and you\u2019ll see a banner prompting you to create a PR with your recent changes. Create a PR, filling out the description according to the template. Remember to link the issue that the PR fixes in the description. fixes #<ISSUE-NUM> The bottom of the PR page displays a list of checks that verify links, Markdown syntax, and more. If you have any errors , make any required changes to your PR, repeating steps 5\u20137. In the right sidebar of your PR, select the reviewer(s) who should review your PR (typically the original issue raiser). Ask the ConsenSys documentation team to review by selecting ConsenSys/protocol-pliny as a reviewer. If you don\u2019t know who to choose or can\u2019t because you\u2019re not a maintainer yet, select the reviewers listed by GitHub or keep the default value. Make any required changes to your PR based on reviewer feedback, repeating steps 5\u20137. After your PR is validated, all checks have passed, and your branch has no conflicts with the target branch, you can merge your PR. You can delete the topic branch after merging your PR. Tip You can use a Git client such as Fork instead of the command line.

You must have access to the ConsenSys Quorum Diagrams template files on Figma to create a diagram. You can add a diagram to the documentation using the normal contribution workflow of creating a pull request (PR). Create diagrams to illustrate: Detailed or simplified product architecture. Technical processes and flows. Concept charts and tables. Demo \u00b6 The following video demonstrates creating a diagram for the GoQuorum documentation using Figma: Figma diagram guidelines \u00b6 Use the following general guidelines when creating ConsenSys diagrams on Figma. Refer to the Figma help website for more information on getting started with Figma, Figma design elements, and more. Basics \u00b6 In the Quorum Diagrams file on Figma, each page contains diagrams for a different product. When creating a new diagram, create a new white frame in the product\u2019s page. Add frames within the white frame for each iteration of the diagram. For each diagram, create a frame 756px wide using the Global Background color (#F6F6F6). You can resize a diagram\u2019s height, but keep the width at 756px. Anchor your elements to the frame using Left and Top constraints . You can group and rename and organize elements. Tips Hold down Cmd on Mac or Ctrl on Windows to select elements excluding the frame. Hold down Option and drag to duplicate an element. Style \u00b6 Use the premade diagram assets as starting points. By default, you can adjust the width of the premade labels, but the height is automatically sized to the number of lines of text. To freely customize a component, right-click on it, detach instance , and remove auto layout . Use the pre-defined color styles or black (#00000). Use rounded corners of radius 2 for rectangular labels and containers. Evenly align elements. Represent similar conceptual elements using similar styles. For example, represent two nodes using a dark gradient, and represent two external components using a light gradient. You can reuse existing icons from any diagram on any page. For example, there are already icons to represent databases, dapps, keys, locks, and logos. Tip Hold down Shift when drawing, resizing, and rotating to create perfect horizontal and vertical lines. Text \u00b6 Use font Roboto for all text. Use font sizes between 10\u201318. Use sentence-style capitalization in labels and titles. Arrows and lines \u00b6 Use a thickness of 2 for arrows, lines, borders, and other strokes. Use Triangle arrow heads. Use straight arrows and lines, with right-angle bends if needed. Don\u2019t use diagonal arrows and lines. If possible, don\u2019t overlap arrows and lines. To create additional bends in an arrow or line, detach instance (if applicable), double-click the arrow or line, and click and drag the anchor points. Leave about 3px of space between arrow heads and the elements they point to. Line ends without arrow heads should touch the connecting element. Example See the Figma documentation on the Arrow Tool for more information. Export \u00b6 To export your diagram: Select the frame of your diagram. Make sure all elements of your diagram are contained in the frame. The name of this frame will be the name of the exported image. Scroll to the bottom of the right sidebar. In the Export section, choose 2x scale (for retina screens) and PNG or SVG file format. Export the diagram to the image folder of the documentation site (for example, doc.goquorum/docs/images ). See Figma\u2019s guide to exports for more information. Embed the diagram into a documentation page using ![<alternative description of your image>](<path to your image file> \"optional image title\") , then create your PR.

These guidelines aim to keep the documentation consistent, well-organized, and easy to understand. General guidelines \u00b6 Be consistent - Consistency helps users follow and understand the documentation. By being consistent with your word choices, visual formatting, and style of communication, users know what to expect when they read the documentation. For example, use consistent sentence structures when writing step-by-step instructions . Be simple but technically correct - Avoid technical jargon and assume the user isn\u2019t an Ethereum expert. When an understanding of a complex Ethereum concept is required, you can refer users to external resources. For example, to explain how the EVM works, link to a resource such as the Ethereum Wiki . Be proactive and suggest good practices - Anticipate users\u2019 needs and guide them through a process. This often takes the form of notes or tips alongside the main explanation. Put yourself in the user\u2019s shoes and consider what questions you\u2019d have when reading the documentation. Documenting good practices is also important. For example, instruct users to secure private keys and protect RPC endpoints in production environments. Be informative but concise - Provide enough information to help users develop a mental model of how the software works without forcing them to read too much text or redundant detail. Cut down your text by using simple words and concise sentences . Be inclusive - ConsenSys documentation aims to be inclusive to all users. Refer to the Google inclusive documentation guide and the Microsoft bias-free communication guide as starting points. Writing style guide \u00b6 ConsenSys documentation follows the Microsoft Writing Style Guide , which is a straightforward reference for natural and clear writing style. The following are some important style recommendations: Abbreviations - Avoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they\u2019re well-known or often repeated in the documentation. Use \u201cfor example\u201d instead of \u201ce.g,\u201d and \u201cthat is\u201d instead of \u201ci.e.\u201d Active voice - Use active voice where possible. Use \u201cyou\u201d to create a personal tone. Code samples - Provide code samples that can be copied and pasted in a console or editor with minimal editing, and work as expected. When writing code samples in a programming language, refer to the programming language\u2019s style guide. Always provide code samples as text in a code block; never use screenshots that would force the user to type it manually. When breaking up lines in a command sample, add line breaks ( \\ ) to ensure it can work when pasted. Don\u2019t include the console prompt ( > , $ , # , % , or the full user@mycomputer Develop % ) or other characters that would prevent the command to run when pasted. If values must be replaced in a sample, use placeholders such as <your IP address> . Contractions - Use common contractions, such as \u201cit\u2019s\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re,\u201d to create a friendly, informal tone. Sentence case for headings - Use sentence case instead of title case for headings. \u201cWe recommend\u201d - In general, don\u2019t use first person.

You can copy the permalink by selecting the ellipses ( ... ) in the upper right corner of the file page, and selecting Copy permalink . Refer to the Microsoft Guide for any other questions on style. Documentation categories \u00b6 A typical documentation page falls into one of the following four categories: How to - How-to content provides instructions to achieve a specific outcome. How-to content assumes users already have some basic knowledge or understanding of the product. Concepts - Conceptual content provides background information and context about a feature. Conceptual content can explain what the feature is, how it works at a high level, why it\u2019s needed, and when and where it\u2019s used. Tutorials - Tutorials provide a set of end-to-end steps to complete a project. Tutorials are complete and reproducible. They don\u2019t assume users have prior knowledge of the subject or required tools. Reference - Reference content provides technical descriptions of APIs, command line options, and other elements of code. Reference content is straightforward and doesn\u2019t include long explanations or guides. A page in each category should link to the related pages in the other categories, if they exist. For more information about these documentation types and the differences between them, refer to the Divio documentation system guide .","title":"Style guide"},{"location":"contribute/style-guide/#documentation-style-guide","text":"The following are writing style guidelines for contributing to the ConsenSys documentation.

By being consistent with your word choices, visual formatting, and style of communication, users know what to expect when they read the documentation. For example, use consistent sentence structures when writing step-by-step instructions . Be simple but technically correct - Avoid technical jargon and assume the user isn\u2019t an Ethereum expert. When an understanding of a complex Ethereum concept is required, you can refer users to external resources. For example, to explain how the EVM works, link to a resource such as the Ethereum Wiki . Be proactive and suggest good practices - Anticipate users\u2019 needs and guide them through a process. This often takes the form of notes or tips alongside the main explanation. Put yourself in the user\u2019s shoes and consider what questions you\u2019d have when reading the documentation. Documenting good practices is also important. For example, instruct users to secure private keys and protect RPC endpoints in production environments. Be informative but concise - Provide enough information to help users develop a mental model of how the software works without forcing them to read too much text or redundant detail. Cut down your text by using simple words and concise sentences . Be inclusive - ConsenSys documentation aims to be inclusive to all users.

Use \u201cfor example\u201d instead of \u201ce.g,\u201d and \u201cthat is\u201d instead of \u201ci.e.\u201d Active voice - Use active voice where possible. Use \u201cyou\u201d to create a personal tone. Code samples - Provide code samples that can be copied and pasted in a console or editor with minimal editing, and work as expected. When writing code samples in a programming language, refer to the programming language\u2019s style guide. Always provide code samples as text in a code block; never use screenshots that would force the user to type it manually. When breaking up lines in a command sample, add line breaks ( \\ ) to ensure it can work when pasted. Don\u2019t include the console prompt ( > , $ , # , % , or the full user@mycomputer Develop % ) or other characters that would prevent the command to run when pasted. If values must be replaced in a sample, use placeholders such as <your IP address> .

Old system MkDocs configuration \u00b6 For sites using the old documentation system , MkDocs is configured in the mdkocs.yml file at the root of the repository. This file configures: Site metadata and variables. Theme. Page navigation. Extensions. Plugins. Page redirects. If you add pages to the documentation (rather than updating existing pages), add your new pages to the nav section of mkdocs.yml .

If you move an existing page to another location or rename it, the public path changes. Create a redirect in mkdocs.redirects.yml . Format Markdown for documentation \u00b6 Having a standard for formatting Markdown helps writers and reviewers navigate the code and review changes. The following are rules for formatting Markdown in ConsenSys documentation: The name of each documentation folder and Markdown file must contain only lowercase letters and dashes ( - ). For example, get-started , truffle.md , and performance-best-practices.md . Each Markdown file must contain a header composed of metadata and limited by three dashes ( - ). Example --- title: Installation overview description: Overview and requirements to install the software --- For the rest of the Markdown code, each line should be (roughly) limited to 100 columns long to be readable on any editor. You\u2019ll receive a warning, not an error, if you exceed 100 columns. Lines must be wrapped without cutting the line in the middle of a word. One line break displays as a space. Example In this example, this first sentence exceeds 100 characters, so we recommend wrapping it into multiple lines. One line break displays as a space, so this Markdown renders as one paragraph without line breaks. We also recommend starting each new sentence on a new line, even if the previous line didn't reach 100 columns, for easy reviewing. You can set a column marker in your text editor as a heuristic. Use only one first level title (prefixed with a single # ) on a page. No HTML markup can be used inside a Markdown document. You can use many extensions that have similar capabilities without HTML. There\u2019s one exception where HTML is tolerated: tables that are too complex and already exist. If possible, keep the table simple without any elements other than table , tr , and td . If using Markdown tables, format them so they\u2019re also readable in the source code. For example, add an appropriate number of spaces to align the columns in the source code.

The following are the available extensions for ConsenSys documentation. Important Extensions are only available for the Markdown files under the docs directory. Abbreviations \u00b6 We recommend avoiding the use of abbreviations, but some such as \u201cPoW\u201d for \u201cproof of work\u201d or \u201cdapp\u201d for \u201cdecentralized application\u201d have become part of the Ethereum jargon. The Abbreviations extension enables defining abbreviations, so that the full form displays when you hover over the abbreviation. Define abbreviations at the end of the Markdown file. Example --- description: This is an example page --- # My example This page explains PoA networks. ... more text ... *[PoA]: proof of authority Call-outs \u00b6 The Admonition extension enables call-out blocks. These are used frequently in the ConsenSys documentation to include side content or highlight important content. Begin each call-out with three exclamation points and the call-out type . You can change the call-out title by adding it in quotes. Example syntax !!! note This is a multi-line note in the ConsenSys documentation. You can replace `note` with a different call-out type. The default note title is `Note` . Each line in the call-out content must be indented by four spaces to be included in the call-out. Example rendering Note This is a multi-line note in the ConsenSys documentation. You can replace note with a different call-out type. The default note title is Note . Each line in the call-out content must be indented by four spaces to be included in the call-out. Supported types include: Note : Used to add information about a subject that doesn\u2019t always need to be taken into account. For example, \u201cWhen running on localhost, include 127.0.0.1 as a listed IP address.\u201d Important : Used to add important information about a subject that should always be taken into account. For example, \u201cAllow Docker up to 6G of memory.\u201d Example : Used to display an example. This is often used with a code sample . Example syntax !!! example \"Example JSON result\" ```json { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 53 , \"result\" : true } ``` Example rendering Example JSON result { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 53 , \"result\" : true } Info : Used to add non-essential detail about a subject. For example, \u201cThe miner coinbase account is one of the accounts defined in the genesis file.\u201d Tip : Used to add information that could help improve the use of a tool. For example, \u201cTo restart the private network in the future, start from step 4.\u201d Caution : Used to warn the users to proceed with caution. For example, \u201cConfiguring alternative elliptic curves is an experimental feature.\u201d Warning : Used to warn the users about something important. For example, \u201cThis will be deprecated in the next version.\u201d Critical : Used to alert the user about a potential dangerous effect such as a risk of destroying something or losing assets. For example, \u201cNever use the development private keys for production use.\u201d Collapsible call-outs \u00b6 The Details extension enables collapsible call-outs by replacing the exclamation points with question marks. The call-out can be open or collapsed by default. This helps reduce the content length and enables a faster overview of the whole page. Example syntax ???+ note \"Collapsible note\" This is a collapsible note. The plus sign makes it open by default. Remove the plus sign and it will be collapsed by default. Example rendering Collapsible note This is a collapsible note. The plus sign makes it open by default. Remove the plus sign and it will be collapsed by default. Checklists \u00b6 The Tasklist extension enables displaying an unordered list as a checklist. Example syntax - [ ] This list item has an unchecked checkbox. - [x] This list item has a checked checkbox. Example rendering This list item has an unchecked checkbox. This list item has a checked checkbox. Code samples \u00b6 The SuperFences extension enables using code blocks to present code samples in the documentation. A basic code block uses triple back ticks (`) and the language name to enable syntax highlighting . Always surround code blocks with blank lines. Example syntax ```json { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 1 , \"result\" : true } ``` Example rendering { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 1 , \"result\" : true } Tabbed code blocks \u00b6 SuperFences also enables tabbed code blocks. The following example groups usage syntax and an example in different tabs in the same block. Example syntax === \"Syntax\" ```bash ethsigner --chain-id = <chainId> ``` === \"Example\" ```bash ethsigner --chain-id = 1337 ``` Example rendering Syntax ethsigner --chain-id = <chainId> Example ethsigner --chain-id = 1337 Line numbers \u00b6 SuperFences also enables adding line numbers to long code samples, which makes it easier when discussing the sample. The line numbers only appear in a code block that uses the linenums=\"1\" parameter. Example syntax ```javascript linenums=\"1\" const Web3 = require(\"web3\"); const Web3Quorum = require(\"web3js-quorum\"); const web3 = new Web3Quorum(new Web3(\"http://localhost:22000\")); web3.priv.generateAndSendRawTransaction(options); ``` Example rendering 1 2 3 4 const Web3 = require ( \"web3\" ); const Web3Quorum = require ( \"web3js-quorum\" ); const web3 = new Web3Quorum ( new Web3 ( \"http://localhost:22000\" )); web3 . priv . generateAndSendRawTransaction ( options ); Code syntax highlight \u00b6 The Highlight extension enables automatic syntax highlighting of code blocks. Define the code language after the code block delimiter to ensure correct highlighting. If you don\u2019t provide the language name, the extension attempts to automatically discover it, but this can lead to errors. Example syntax ```json { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 51 , \"result\" : { \"startingBlock\" : \"0x5a0\" , \"currentBlock\" : \"0xad9\" , \"highestBlock\" : \"0xad9\" } } ``` Example rendering { \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\" , \"id\" : 51 , \"result\" : { \"startingBlock\" : \"0x5a0\" , \"currentBlock\" : \"0xad9\" , \"highestBlock\" : \"0xad9\" } } Refer to the full list of support languages . Definitions \u00b6 The Definition List extension enables listing definitions. This may be useful for creating glossaries. Example syntax Consensus layer : The layer of the Ethereum network that enforces network rules, and generates and verifies blocks. Also known as \"Ethereum 2.0\" or \"Eth2.\" Execution layer : The layer of the Ethereum network that contains and executes smart contracts. Also known as \"Ethereum 1.0\" or \"Eth1.\" Example rendering Consensus layer The layer of the Ethereum network that enforces network rules, and generates and verifies blocks. Also known as \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d or \u201cEth2.\u201d Execution layer The layer of the Ethereum network that contains and executes smart contracts. Also known as \u201cEthereum 1.0\u201d or \u201cEth1.\u201d Emojis \u00b6 You can use emojis in the Markdown. Emojis are fun, but they can also be useful to draw the user\u2019s attention. Use only neutral emojis such as :warning: , which displays . Refer to the full list of available emojis . Footnotes \u00b6 The Footnotes extension enables adding footnotes at the end of a page. Example --- description: This is an example page --- # My example You can add a footnote[^1] to provide additional information about a subject. The footnote number displays as a clickable superscript that takes the user to the footnote. ... more text ... [ ^1 ]: The footnote goes here. A clickable arrow displays that takes the user back to the original text. When writing multi-line footnotes, indent each line with four spaces. Global content \u00b6 If you have content to be repeated on multiple pages, you can create it in a common page in the /docs/global directory and include it in all required pages. For example, use { !global/test_accounts.md! } minus the spaces between the brackets and exclamation points to include the content of the test_accounts.md page in another page. Info The exclude plugin excludes pages in the /docs/global directory (configurable in mkdocs.yml or, if using the new system, in mkdocs.exclude.yml ) from the final rendered site, since otherwise, every Markdown file is rendered and copied. It\u2019s useful to prevent global files to be reachable as standalone pages, since they\u2019re intended to be included in other pages. Excluded pages are still in the source repository, but they aren\u2019t copied in the final site and don\u2019t appear in the search results. Highlight \u00b6 The Mark extension enables highlighting of text. Text surrounded by double equal signs is highlighted in yellow. Example syntax ==This is highlighted text== Example rendering This is highlighted text Key presses \u00b6 The Keys extension enables styling key presses by surrounding them with double plus signs. Example syntax ++ctrl+alt+delete++ Example rendering Ctrl + Alt + Del Magic links \u00b6 The MagicLink extension automatically displays a URL as a link. You don\u2019t need to surround the URL with Markdown link syntax. Math \u00b6 The Arithmatex extension enables rendered math formulas in the documentation using MathJax syntax. Example syntax $\\sigma=\\displaystyle\\prod_{k=1}^t\\sigma_{i_k}^{L_{i_k}(0)}$ Constructing the threshold signature $\\sigma$ from $t$ individual signatures $\\sigma_{i_k}$, $k=1,\\dots,t$ and the Lagrange polynomials $L_{i_1}, \\dots,L_{i_t}$ associated to the set $I=\\{i _1,\\dots,i_ t\\}$ of signers. Example rendering \\(\\sigma=\\displaystyle\\prod_{k=1}^t\\sigma_{i_k}^{L_{i_k}(0)}\\) Constructing the threshold signature \\(\\sigma\\) from \\(t\\) individual signatures \\(\\sigma_{i_k}\\) , \\(k=1,\\dots,t\\) and the Lagrange polynomials \\(L_{i_1}, \\dots,L_{i_t}\\) associated to the set \\(I=\\{i_1,\\dots,i_t\\}\\) of signers. Plant UML diagrams \u00b6 You can add diagrams using Plant UML syntax. Example syntax ```plantuml format=\"svg\" alt=\"Plantum diagram example\" title=\"My super diagram\" Actor1 -> Actor2: calls Actor1 <-- Actor2: responds ``` Example rendering Strikethrough \u00b6 The Tilde extension enables displaying text strikethrough by surrounding the text with double tildes ( ~ ). Example syntax ~~This text is struck through~~ Example rendering This text is struck through Symbols \u00b6 The SmartSymbols extension enables symbols. For example, --> displays as \u2192. TOC \u00b6 The Table of Contents extension automatically displays a table of contents of the current page on the right side of the page. It displays titles to the third level (titles prefixed with ### ). This extension also displays a permalink on the right of any title. This permalink can be used to point directly to the title from another website. Variables \u00b6 The Extra Variables plugin enables using values from the extra section in mkdocs.yml , or if using the new system, from mkdocs.extra.yml , as variables in the Markdown code. For example, if you have the following in mkdocs.yml or mkdocs.extra.yml : extra: support: email: quorum@consensys.net You can display the email in any documentation page using: {{ support.email }} Videos \u00b6 Important The Video extension is only supported on the new documentation system .
