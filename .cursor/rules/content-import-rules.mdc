Mission

- Migrate operator-relevant information into the Linea Stack documentation.
- Enable a technical operator to run a private, hybrid, or public Linea network.
- Use the Linea monorepo https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo strictly as a source of information, not as a target for changes.
- Prefer correctness, safety, and clarity over completeness or polish.

Target information architecture

The Linea Stack documentation is organized as follows:

Linea Stack
- docs/stack/overview/*
- docs/stack/how-it-works/overview/*
- docs/stack/how-it-works/architecture/*
- docs/stack/how-it-works/deployment-models/*
- docs/stack/how-it-works/boundaries-and-responsibilities/*
- docs/stack/guides/deployment/*
- docs/stack/guides/configuration/*
- docs/stack/guides/operations/*
- docs/stack/features/*

Hard boundaries (must not be violated)

- Never edit, move, rename, or create files under docs/network/.
- Never edit, move, rename, or create files in the Linea monorepo.
- Never introduce assumptions, inferred behavior, or undocumented defaults.
- Never invent configuration values, ports, flags, environment variables, RPC methods, or operational steps.
- Never change technical meaning, guarantees, or responsibilities expressed in source material.

Monorepo source-of-truth handling (read-only)

- The Linea monorepo is a read-only source of information.
- Cursor must treat the monorepo as reference material only.
- No edits, moves, deletions, refactors, comments, or TODOs are allowed in the monorepo.
- No git diff originating from the monorepo will ever be pushed, reviewed, or accepted.

Content usage rules for the monorepo

- Information may be extracted, summarized, or paraphrased from the monorepo into docs/stack/*.
- Extraction must preserve technical meaning exactly.
- Do not normalize, reformat, or “clean up” monorepo content in place.
- If content appears incorrect or incomplete, reflect this only in the destination documentation via TODOs.

Operational rule

- All documentation changes must occur exclusively within the documentation repository.
- If content appears to be in the wrong place in the monorepo, do NOT move it.
  Instead:
  - Copy or summarize the relevant information into the appropriate docs/stack/* location.
  - Link back to the monorepo for traceability when useful.
  - Leave the monorepo untouched.

Content classification rules

Use the following rules to decide where content belongs:

Top-level routing:
- “How does Linea work?” → docs/protocol/*
- “How do I run Linea?” → docs/stack/*
- “How do I work with Linea Mainnet?” → docs/network/* (do not touch)

Within Linea Stack:
- “Can I do X?” → docs/stack/features/*
- “How do I do X?” → docs/stack/guides/*
- “What is X?” → docs/stack/how-it-works/*
- “Why does X behave this way?” → docs/stack/how-it-works/boundaries-and-responsibilities/*

If content currently lives in docs/protocol/* but is primarily operator-facing (deployment steps, runbooks,
operational behavior), it may be moved into docs/stack/* following the rules above. In such cases always add a movedFrom: property to the receiving page and link the original path in case maintainers wish to revert the decision.

Handling incomplete or missing information

- If required information is missing, unclear, or incomplete in the source material:
  - Do not guess.
  - Do not fill gaps from general blockchain or systems knowledge.
  - Add a `todo:` entry to the destination page metadata describing what information is missing and why.
  - You may use html comments to further describe the todo

Linking and summarization rules

- When Stack documentation depends on protocol-level mechanics:
  - Link to the relevant Protocol documentation.
  - Provide a brief operator-oriented summary (1–2 sentences).
  - Do not duplicate full protocol explanations.

- Prefer linking over copying when the content is explanatory rather than operational.

Moving and restructuring content

- Content may be moved or reorganized within docs/stack/* to improve clarity and correctness.
- Preserve meaning exactly when moving or restructuring.
- Update internal links to reflect new locations.
- Do not change URLs unless necessary.
- If a URL must change, add appropriate redirects
- Never add redirects that impact docs/network/.

Operator-first constraints

- Assume the reader is a competent technical operator, not an end user.
- Optimize for safe execution, clear responsibility boundaries, and failure awareness.
- Explicitly state assumptions, prerequisites, and failure modes when present in source material.
- Avoid marketing language or value claims unless they are already explicit in the source.

Quality bar

Every page introduced or modified in Linea Stack must satisfy all of the following:

- The reader can clearly tell whether the page is explanatory, instructional, or capability-focused.
- No operational steps rely on undocumented or inferred behavior.
- All technical claims are traceable to source material or linked Protocol documentation.
- Missing critical information is surfaced explicitly via TODO metadata, not hidden in prose.
- Besu documentation is a good quality standard. A user can operate a node by following the clear consise details: https://besu.hyperledger.org/
- OP documentation https://docs.optimism.io/op-stack/protocol/getting-started is a good quality standard for the high-level "How it works" items (however is bad quality in terms of diataxis structure)
- ZK sync docs share a similar docs structure standard: https://docs.zksync.io/ however, the trust assumptions of their users is far lower than linea, so they are not considered good quality standard
