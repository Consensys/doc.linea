# Tutorial Content Recommendations for Linea Documentation

Based on analysis of major L2 competitors (Base, Scroll, Arbitrum, zkSync, Optimism, Polygon, Mode), this document outlines tutorial content opportunities that would strengthen Linea's developer experience and differentiation.

## Executive Summary

Linea currently has solid technical documentation and some good tutorials, but lacks the comprehensive developer journey and use-case-specific content that leading competitors offer. The recommendations focus on:

1. **Beginner-friendly onboarding** similar to Arbitrum's approach
2. **End-to-end application tutorials** like Base and Scroll provide  
3. **Specialized use case examples** for DeFi, NFTs, gaming, etc.
4. **AI integration tutorials** (unique differentiator for Linea)
5. **Cross-chain and bridging content**
