## What is Linea?

[Linea](https://linea.build/) is a developer-ready layer 2 network, scaling Ethereum by providing
an Ethereum-equivalent environment in which to execute transactions, which are then submitted to
Ethereum Mainnet through a zero-knowledge rollup.

This documentation repository is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and the site
itself is published at [`docs.linea.build`](https://docs.linea.build/).

3. Make your changes, paying attention to our [contribution guidelines](#contribution-guidelines).
4. Review your changes locally. See our [guide](#running-locally) on previewing your 
changes locally.
5. Submit your changes as a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
New pull requests are reviewed regularly.

Our team will do our best to help you get the PR over the line, though we cannot guarantee our 
capacity. For this reason, please do not submit a PR if you think you'll be unable to address 
necessary changes, fix linter errors, or otherwise address feedback. If you're in this position,
consider creating an issue instead.

### Contribution guidelines

The style of the documentation is based on the [Consensys style guide](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/style-guide),
other than for images and other media, for which we have [specific guidelines](#adding-images-to-articles).

#### Orthography

Some key points include:
- Sentence case for all headings and subheadings.
  - More generally, and if in doubt, stick to lowercase for nouns unless you're referencing a 
  product name or feature.
- Use [descriptive link text](https://developers.google.com/style/link-text?hl=en) — embed the link
in your statement rather than asking the reader to "click here" or similar.

#### Markdown style

Additionally, please adhere to these rules: 
- **Use `.mdx` files.** The docs site is standardized to use `.mdx` files rather than `.md` files to
ensure that React components and other elements can be rendered properly. 
- **Use HTML-like formatting** rather than traditional Markdown formatting. For example, create a 
`<table>` rather than using the Markdown syntax with dashes and vertical lines. In many cases, 
HTML syntax is easier to maintain. Standardization also applies here: some elements we frequently
use, such as `<Tabs>`, _must_ use HTMl syntax, so applying HTML universally helps to avoid the site 
containing a mix of both styles.
- Use a YAML-style front matter at the top of each file, like this: (check existing files for an 
example)
   ```
   ---
   title: Title of the article
   description: Description of the article
   ---
   ```

> [!TIP]
> You may notice a field in the front matter of our docs called `image`, like:
> `image: /img/socialCards/architecture.jpg`. **This field is auto-generated
> on build, so don't add it manually.**
  
Please return to any submitted PRs regularly to help us work through feedback and comments and 
merge as soon as we can. If you do not return to your PR for edits within three months of us 
reviewing, we will close the PR. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The files at `api/linea-smart-contracts` are automatically generated, and should not be edited.

#### Guidance for ecosystem contributions

By "ecosystem contributions", we mean contributions from projects in the Linea ecosystem, such as 
dapps, libraries, or tooling. If your submission is in this category, please keep the following
guidelines in mind:

- Your contribution should be informative above all; the docs are not a marketing tool for your 
project. We may request edits to adjust your writing style if we feel it falls on the wrong side of 
this line. We encourage you to write about your project's features and benefits, but please avoid 
superlatives or selling your project.
- You are responsible for maintaining the information about your project. Out-of-date docs will be 
an inconvenience for users at best, or leave a negative impression of your project at worst. This 
includes keeping links to external sites up-to-date and returning for updates as your project
matures.

### Contribute to the Zero-Knowledge Glossary

Diving into zero-knowledge rollups and getting stumped by the technical jargon? We've started an
open source Zero-Knowledge glossary to define some common terms you might encounter as you dive
into the L2 landscape.

[Fork our repo](https://github.com/Consensys/doc.linea/fork), and add a term in alphabetical
order to `docs/zero-knowledge-glossary/index.mdx`. Then, make a pull request and tag us for review!

### Additional resources

View the [Consensys doc contribution guidelines](https://docs-template.consensys.net/) for
information on how to:

- [Submit a contribution](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/submit-a-contribution) using forks and pull requests.
- Consult the [documentation style guide](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/style-guide).
- [Format your Markdown](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/format-markdown) correctly.
- [Preview the docs](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/preview) locally.

## Running locally

You will need to have Node.js installed to run the live previews of the docs locally.

It is highly recommended that you use a tool like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
to manage Node.js versions on your machine.

### Installing recommended Node.js version with `nvm`

1. Follow the above instructions to install `nvm` on your machine, or go [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
2. Go to the root folder of this project in your terminal.
3. Run `nvm install` followed by `nvm use`. This will install the version specified by this project in the `.nvmrc` file.

### Running this project

1. Navigate to root folder of the project after installing Node.js
2. Run the following in sequence, which only needs to be done once:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. To preview and for every time afterwards:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Build

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static
contents hosting service.

To run the local build you created, run:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

### Check spelling and style

This repository includes multiple linters, which you can think of as spell-checks that also inspect
code formatting and standards, and a lot more. It's possible that you might use an unrecognized word,
style your Markdown incorrectly, or otherwise format your content in a way that conflicts with 
style guides.

The main linter, Vale, is run through Github Actions and checks spelling, formatting, and adherence to
various style guides. Please pay attention to its suggestions and error warnings in the check that
runs on your PR. These errors will not prevent your PR from building, but you should address them
nevertheless. 

See our [guidance on using Vale](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/run-vale) for more
information.

You can run other linters for code style (CSS, JavaScript) and link formatting any time with the 
command `npm run lint`.

## Adding images to articles

### Add image files

Any images for articles should be added to the `/static/img/` directory. Here, the `/img` folder
structure mirrors that of the docs, and images are stored in the corresponding subdirectory. If
you have added a _new_ article in `/docs`, create the new subdirectory in `/img` according to this
structure.

#### Format image files

Use the following JSX formatting to add an image into an article:

```
<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
      <img
        src="/img/path-to-file/image.png"
        alt="alt text here"
      />
  </div>
</div>
```

To adjust the display size of the image, adjust the size class to one of the following:

`img-xsmall`, `img-small`, `img-medium`, `img-large`

Adhere to using these predefined sizings where possible.

#### Format svg files

Use the following formatting for svg files. Place the import statement at the top of the file,
beneath the front matter.

```
import MySVGGraphic from "/img/path-to-file/image.svg";
```
```
<div className="img-large">
  <MySVGGraphic />
</div>
```

As outlined above, you can adjust the display size of the svg by changing the class applied.

### Social cards

A social card for any new article(s) will be generated and applied when the site builds, so there
is no need to manually create or add one.
